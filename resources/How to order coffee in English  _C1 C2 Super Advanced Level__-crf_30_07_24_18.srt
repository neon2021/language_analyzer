5

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 one of the first things you learn in english and it can be very simple can i have a coffee please

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 this way of ordering a coffee is absolutely fine it's perfect in fact although it probably

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 wouldn't work in somewhere like starbucks where an order is more like can i get a doppio half-calf

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 skinny mocha venti to go i know i do but that's not what we're talking about today i want to order

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 a normal coffee in advanced english and i know what some people are going to say when they hear

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 my order people never speak like that i agree i agree it's not necessary but it's fun and it's

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 cool and if we can't have fun cool english lessons then what have we got

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 i think it's fun to see how far we can take it and more importantly for you i think it's a fun and

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 memorable way to introduce some advanced grammatical structures and vocabulary are you ready

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 we're going to move up through the levels level one black coffee please this is the simplest way

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 to order a coffee and it's perhaps not the most polite way to order in a coffee shop but if you're

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 ordering as part of a group after dinner for example i think it's fine the addition of please

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 at the end though is important

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 let's take it up a notch level two can i have a black coffee please here the request is formulated

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 as a question using the modal verb can which makes it more polite than the first one you will often

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 hear this said as can i get a black coffee please this is slightly more common in american english

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 but it's making its way into british english some people don't like the use of get here

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 but a lot of native speakers use it now let's say this more politely

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 level three may i please have a black coffee with a splash of milk all right we're getting a little

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 bit more complex here this is a very polite way to order a coffee using the modal verb may you can

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 also replace may with the modal verb could which is a more polite way to make requests than can

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 you can also see that the word please has moved from the end to directly after may i this front

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 loading of please emphasizes the politeness of the request

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 we are also now asking for a splash of milk and a splash means a small amount of liquid

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 of you can use a brackets now it's a интonation right so a recursive application of a fast

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 and heavy milk that releases small amounts of liquid into a soften milk

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 from the outside and sets a formal tone from the outset

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 we are also now asking for a splash of milk and a splash means a small amount of liquid

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 three and instead of please we can see the adverb kindly this is another way to soften a request and

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 make it more polite let's add a little more advanced language level five would it be possible

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 for you to brew a medium-sized black coffee with a splash of milk two sugars and a sprinkling of

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 cinnamon on top all right this one is even more polite and a bit poetic as well would it be

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 possible is a very polite way to form a question we also have some more advanced vocabulary

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 including to brew meaning to make a hot drink like coffee or tea and sprinkling

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 which means a small amount of liquid or powder that is dropped onto a surface

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 can i make it even more advanced level six and we're not even at the end yet

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 if it's not too much trouble could you please craft a medium-sized black coffee

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 enriched with a splash of a

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 organic milk, and precisely two cubes of raw sugar

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 while ensuring it's brewed to the optimum temperature,

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 and then garnish it with a delicate sprinkling

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 of cinnamon on top.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 We're moving into nightmare customer territory now.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 If it's not too much trouble is a very polite way

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 of asking someone to do something,

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 we often add it to the beginning of a request,

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 often when we know the request

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 is going to cause some extra effort.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Now we're asking for the barista to craft the coffee,

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 not just make one, craft.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 This means to make objects in a skilled way,

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 especially with your hands.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And the coffee is to be enriched with a splash of milk.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 To enrich means to make the quality of something better

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 by adding something else.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Then it is to be brewed to the optimum temperature.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Optimum means best possible.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 You might hear the synonym optimal or optimal

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 used in American English.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And then we have,

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 garnished with cinnamon.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 To garnish means to decorate food or drink

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 with a small amount of food.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Can this customer get any worse?

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Yes, the answer is yes.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 If you've ever worked in retail or hospitality,

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 you know the answer is yes.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Here is my coffee order in its final form, level seven.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Would you be so kind as to commence the artisanal preparation

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 of a medium sized black coffee

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 with a coffee with a single origin beans

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 and brewed at precisely 89 degrees Celsius?

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 It should be complemented with a splash of organic,

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 locally sourced milk,

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 sweetened to a modest degree

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 with exactly two cubes of raw sugar

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 and adorned with a subtle yet discernible sprinkling

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 of hand ground cinnamon.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Finally, because I'm not done yet,

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I request that it be presented in a ceramic mug

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 featuring a handle ergonomically designed for a right-handed individual.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 I would like to see a copy of this recipe in my next video.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Someone is definitely going to spit in this customer's coffee.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Let's look at the grammar.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Would you be so kind as to,

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 is a very, very polite and formal way to make a request.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And in the final sentence, you saw the structure,

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I request that it be presented.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 This sentence uses the subjunctive mood,

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 which is a formal structure in English

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 and appears after certain verbs like request.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And the vocabulary, first there is to commence,

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 which means to begin.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 We had artisanal, artisanal,

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 meaning prepared in a traditional way.

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 We have complimented.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 This is the verb to compliment with an E.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It's different to the one with I.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 If one thing compliments with an E,

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 another, it goes well with the other thing

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 and it makes it better.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 We compliment each other, we go well together,

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 we make each other better.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 We compliment each other means we give each other compliments.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I like your dress.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 I like your hair.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I like your coffee.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 What did you ask for?

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I'm gonna ask for that.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Little did she know.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 We also have adorned with.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 The verb to adorn means to add something decorative

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 to a person or thing to make it more attractive.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 We also have the adjectives subtle and discernible.

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Subtle means not obvious or noticeable,

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 while discernible means able to be recognised.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 So I wanted it subtle, but discernible.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 So I wanted it subtle, but discernible.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And finally, perhaps the most egregious request,

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 an ergonomically designed handle.

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Ergonomically means in a way that makes something,

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 often equipment or furniture,

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 comfortable and effective for people who use it.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 You'll see all of this grammar,

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 all of the vocabulary along with example sentences

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 in the PDF that goes with this lesson.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 So remember to download that by clicking the link down below.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 What did you think of my sentence?

141
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 What did you think of my C1 level coffee order?

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Is it realistic?

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 No.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Is it interesting?

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I think so.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And I hope it will help you to remember

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 some of the structures and vocabulary that I've presented.

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 We really do use all of these words and phrases in real life.

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I really hope you enjoyed this lesson.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 If you have any requests for future C1 level

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 ridiculous videos, please let me know in the comments.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 I love writing and making these.

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 One other thing you might be interested in

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 especially if you're interested in English at this level.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I have a really gorgeous C1 programme.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 It's 12 weeks long.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 You can start it immediately.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Over 2000 students have taken this course

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 and they have had fantastic results.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Look at the feedback from some of my amazing C1 students.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 My team and I poured our heart and soul into this course.

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 We worked a story throughout all of the readings

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 and listenings.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 We injected a lot of humour.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 We've even got an entire module on British English humour.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 We've even got an entire module on British English humour.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 We've even got an entire module on British English humour.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We've even got an entire module on British English humour.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 We weave pronunciation throughout the course.

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 We have weekly conversation lessons

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 where you listen in on conversations I've had

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 The people stay intact.

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
