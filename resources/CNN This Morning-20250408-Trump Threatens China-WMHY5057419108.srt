1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
It's Tuesday, April 8th, here's what's happening right now on CNN this morning.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,200
I have great respect for China, but they can't do this.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,760
President Trump threatens to escalate his trade war with China, issuing them an ultimatum

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,280
and a deadline.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,600
The China does not appear to be backing down, plus our team will get to work tomorrow to

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,880
deport these heinous, violent foreign terrorists.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,320
The White House can resume rapid deportations, but there's a catch, new rules from the

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,800
Supreme Court, also.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,240
This is the highest I've seen the water in my lifetime.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,000
The flooding danger is not over as deadly storms leave some communities under water.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,440
And in three short years, we got the University of Florida's basketball program back where

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
it belongs, which is winning national championships.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,600
The Gators' Trump, Florida rallies past Houston to win the title, how they pulled off a comeback

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:14,640
in the final seconds.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,520
It's 6am here on the east coast, here's a live look at Cincinnati, where communities around

16
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,600
the Ohio River could still see some more flooding threat today.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,040
Good morning, everybody, I'm Audit Cornish, I want to thank you for waking up with me.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,480
And the question this morning, who will blink first?

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,760
Donald Trump is threatening even more tariffs on China.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,600
The president says he will impose an additional 50 percent tariff tomorrow if China doesn't

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,560
call off their tariffs today and caught in the middle of this, you, the consumer, here

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
at home.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,240
We are now working right now, we're being working two days a week, mean kind of slow,

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,720
there is no much work right now.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,640
Economy, we're smaller port, we're going to feel it, drivers will work half a day instead

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
of a full day.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,040
All right, so you heard there from a trucking company at the port of Oakland, that's where

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,320
they receive almost half of their shipments from China, and it's just one example of

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,280
how President Trump's tariffs are actually impacting people's lives, even before many

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
of them have gone into effect.

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,600
Some of the world's wealthiest businessmen are also making it clear that they're not

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,160
on board, Richard Branson calling the tariffs a colossal mistake.

33
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,320
Republican Megadoner Ken Lagonate says he doesn't understand the bleeping formula, and Bill

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,000
Ackman, another Trump backing billionaire, warning of a self-induced economic nuclear

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,520
winter.

36
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,640
President Elon Musk says he wants to see this, the U.S. and Europe may be moved to a relationship

37
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,920
with zero tariffs.

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,600
President Trump, however, is not flinching, nor is China.

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,640
This morning, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of economic bullying

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,800
and said that in a trade war quote, China will fight to the end.

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,880
We're trying to keep our prices right where they are for the time being, although again,

42
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,840
we reserve the right over the next month or two or three, as our paper goods start to

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,720
run out to see what tariffs are doing at that point, because those 30 percent tariffs

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,080
out of China and Vietnam are going to be high.

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,320
Okay, a sign that the market may be as resilient as the President hopes U.S. futures are pointing

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
up this morning.

47
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,360
Global markets also ticked up following Monday's major losses.

48
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,080
The group chat is here to discuss Jackie Kassinage, Washington Bureau Chief for the Boston

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,920
Globe, Chuck Rocha, Democratic Strategist, and former Senior Advisor to Bernie Sanders Presidential

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,800
campaigns, and Mike Dubkey, former White House Communications Director during President

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,440
Trump's first term.

52
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Okay, Jackie, I want to start with you because obviously we are seeing a market that is so

53
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,360
desperate for anything that like little rumors actually sent things up and down yesterday.

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
What is it that we're hearing from the White House?

55
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,840
The White House is still projecting that this is something that's going to work, that

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,080
they just need patience, and frankly, you're seeing it reflected back at them on the

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
hill.

58
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,080
They've managed to kind of quash any effort to, at this point, to claw back some power

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:29,480
to Congress, Republicans who were starting to express some dissent have quieted down.

60
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,200
We'll see how long that lasts as the market continues to do with the market has been doing,

61
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,440
and Congress comes back, but certainly at this point, at least from their party, right

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,760
now everyone is staying in line.

63
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,600
But during that press conference on yesterday, you did have the President say, yeah, I might

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,280
do this, yeah, I might do that, we'll have to see, so the uncertainty still remains even

65
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,640
as they're saying they're being steadfast.

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,640
You know, this latest threat of 50% tariffs that's on top of last week's 34%, 34%, which

67
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,520
is itself on top of the existing 20%, I mean, basically if the President makes good on

68
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,240
all of these promises, Chinese goods would face an effective tariff of 104%, Chuck, how

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:26,200
long do you think people can, I don't know, experience this shift and go along with what

70
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,560
the President wants, because culturally, Americans are used to less expensive goods.

71
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,600
Yes, we've, I would say we've gotten addicted to cheap goods, and people made that economic

72
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,800
philosophy back in the day when Walmart was booming, folks decided that they wanted to buy

73
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,360
lots of cheap stuff from China, but let's talk about the American voter and not the billionaires,

74
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,880
because the American voter is really going to determine what happens here, because we

75
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,520
have a midterm election where they'll be heard in about 18 months, and a regular citizen

76
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,120
out there, he watches or she watches the stock market here there, but they don't understand

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
instability, buybacks, bonds, all the others.

78
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,640
If you're 66 and you're thinking about retiring, sure, you watch it every single day, but

79
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,480
regular folks, there's two things that really affect them politically.

80
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,600
One is when they get their 401k statement, they always look like I do to see if you've

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,920
made a little money or you've lost a little money, and over time, that becomes a problem

82
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,400
with the perception from that voter and the second thing, which we talked about a lot

83
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,200
on this program, which is why Donald Trump got elected, was the price of things, the affordability

84
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
of things.

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,160
Every time's eggs go up, our gas goes up, people feel that because they're buying them

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,000
every single week, and that's where the American public is, if this keeps driving up or drives

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,520
up prices at all, then I think you're going to see a repercussion from the American voter.

88
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,240
Mike Dupke, I want to bring you in, because there's that we've mentioned coffee, we've

89
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,480
talked to the truckers, another interesting data point, Nintendo had just announced its

90
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,400
new consoles, stay with me, the Switch Duo last week, and basically, as soon as it did

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:01,400
that, it had to halt US pre-orders because of Trump tariffs, 24% tariff on Japan basically

92
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,280
could make the device unaffordable for a lot of people.

93
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,800
This could touch people in a lot of different ways, beyond the arguments that the White

94
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
House is making.

95
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,120
Mike, do those moments matter or has the White House just made the argument so cleanly

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,840
that people see this as a way to bring back manufacturing?

97
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,600
So I'm going to answer this in two ways.

98
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,560
First of all, I'm going to agree with a lot of what Chuck just said, and this is going

99
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,880
to be a very happy, you know, cold, get along Tuesday here.

100
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,000
I think the American people, especially the 40% that aren't invested in the stock market

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,600
are looking at those prices every day, and we've seen a slight downturn in inflation,

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,960
we've seen a slight downturn in some prices.

103
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:51,720
So right now for the new base of the Trump administration, and frankly, the Republican

104
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,800
Party do a certain extent, is not revolting on this.

105
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,320
But let's get back to your original question about China.

106
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,440
I think China is the fight that the president wants.

107
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,800
If you look at the Nikkei average this morning, you see that it's rebounding because he's

108
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,200
negotiating with Japan.

109
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,240
With Europe, there's spent some movement.

110
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,560
I think the fight with China is what the president and the administration would like to focus

111
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,760
on, and that's what we're about to see.

112
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,360
So they're setting this up.

113
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,960
I don't think the communications have been great coming out of the White House.

114
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,760
It's been kind of all over the map, but I think it's starting to settle in in a place

115
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,600
that's a positive for Trump.

116
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Okay, stay with me.

117
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
There's a lot going on.

118
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,480
Before we go, I want to play this one last cut from Peter Navarro, basically Trump's

119
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,440
trade advisor, making a promise, and I feel like these are the kinds of promises that

120
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,200
really should be on record.

121
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,640
Dow 50,000, I guarantee that, and I guarantee no recession, okay?

122
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Why?

123
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Because when we pass the biggest, broadest tax cut in history within a matter of months,

124
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,760
that's going to be a great stimulus.

125
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,440
There's not going to be any inflation.

126
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
You guys stay with us.

127
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,360
We're going to talk a lot more this hour about what's going on.

128
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,720
So how should Democrats respond to President Trump's policies that are reshaping America?

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
What's their path forward?

130
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,080
Senator Bernie Sanders is going to look to answer those questions in a CNN town hall that's

131
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,120
going to be posted by Anderson Cooper.

132
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,640
That's happening Wednesday at 9 p.m. Eastern right here on CNN.

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,920
And coming up on CNN this morning, parts of Appalachia still reeling from Hurricane

134
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,640
Helene, and now Doge is looking to decimate staffing at FEMA.

135
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,280
We're going to have Republican Congressman Chuck Edwards.

136
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,440
He represents one of the areas it hardest.

137
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,120
He's going to talk more about that.

138
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Plus, the U.S. and Iran may be sitting down for talks on its nuclear program.

139
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
Can they come to a deal?

140
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,320
And historic rainfall, sending rivers, surging, and the flooding isn't over yet.

141
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,840
The water was up to my thigh, ice cold, and then as I stepped out, I almost failed because

142
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:09,520
the water was dragging me.

143
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,560
I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, host of the Chasing Life Podcast.

144
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,960
What we see is that people who sit on the ground, they're five key times get faster.

145
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,640
They're back, stop hurting.

146
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,320
That's Dr. Kelly Starratt, co-author of a really good book called Built to Move, to give

147
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,360
all of us busy people some of the simple tools to improve our range of motion, our posture,

148
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
decrease our pain, and yes, become more mobile.

149
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:41,200
Listen to Chasing Life, streaming now, wherever you get your podcasts.

150
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,840
All right, if you're getting ready, it's 15 minutes past the hour.

151
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
Here is your morning roundup.

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,640
Some of the stories you need to know to get your day going.

153
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,440
While the rain is over, the danger is not.

154
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,720
Dozens of rivers across the southeast are expected to hit major flood stage this week.

155
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,040
That's adding to the devastation already on the ground.

156
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,160
So for example, in Louisville, river levels rose five feet in 24 hours, and that triggered

157
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,760
a mandatory evacuation order for low-lying communities near the Kentucky River.

158
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,000
It's kind of devastating on that part, you know, it's under siege, basically.

159
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,800
We're lucky enough it's not extremely devastating, but it's hard on a lot of people.

160
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Twenty-four people are now confirmed dead, that's across seven different states.

161
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,360
South Korea announcing it will hold a snap election in June to choose its next leader.

162
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,480
The country's last president was removed just last week by the nation's top port for

163
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,000
trying to impose martial law.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,080
The Trump administration revoking the legal status of migrants who entered the U.S. using

165
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,600
the Biden era CBP1 app as an email from the Department of Homeland Security ordered

166
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,520
them to leave immediately.

167
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,280
It's unclear how many people received the email.

168
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,840
To be clear, more than 900,000 migrants have been allowed to enter the country by making

169
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,920
appointments on the app since 2023.

170
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,680
And a small jet skating off the runway and into the water in Oregon, the plane was cleared

171
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
for approach.

172
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:20,280
The pilot never told controllers they were on the ground.

173
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,880
There were five people on board.

174
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,240
They all have to be taken to the hospital, but for minor injuries.

175
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:34,680
And you gotta see this.

176
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,720
Not exactly a fan of Boris Johnson, the former British Prime Minister, had a run-in with

177
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
an ostrich.

178
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,360
He was driving through a wildlife park in Texas when the animal came up to the window and

179
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
hacked his hand.

180
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,800
Johnson's wife posted this video on Instagram with a caption, too funny not to share.

181
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,840
Built to come on CNN this morning sweeping cuts to programs such as meals on wheels,

182
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,880
the potential crisis now facing millions of seniors and disabled veterans.

183
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,800
Also, the Trump administration revoking even more student visas.

184
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,080
Good morning to San Antonio, home of the NCAA championship game was a late night of

185
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:21,000
partying there for the Florida Gators.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,360
This morning, many programs like meals on wheels are facing an uncertain future, much

187
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,800
like the elderly and disabled Americans who depend on them.

188
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,840
The latest round of dosch cuts hitting the government agency that funds and facilitates

189
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,720
those programs, according to NPR, is going through a reorganization.

190
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,880
Joining me now, the former head of the administration for community living, Alison Barkhoff.

191
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,520
Alison, I think most people don't know that agency very well or what it does.

192
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,760
We're talking about meals on wheels.

193
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,640
I think also LIHEAP correct me if I'm wrong, which helps people get funding for their

194
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,360
heating bills, air conditioning.

195
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,600
What are you hearing from former colleagues about these cuts?

196
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
Good morning and thank you for having me.

197
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,560
A lot of people might not know the administration for community living, but it provides tens

198
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:16,800
of millions of older adults, people with disabilities and family caregivers, life saving services

199
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:24,360
and supports like meals for older adults, senior centers, family caregiver supports, services

200
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:32,200
that help people leave institutions like hospitals and nursing homes and go home.

201
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,600
As you mentioned, HHS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced last

202
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,920
week that the administration for community living would be dismantled and its programs

203
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,480
spread across the department and over half the staff has been terminated.

204
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,360
There's a lot of uncertainty right now about the future of these programs and how they

205
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,360
will be able to continue to support the health, independence and dignity of the millions

206
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,480
of Americans who rely on them day in and day out.

207
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,240
So Alison, just so we're clear, as they said, the programs are not going away.

208
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,760
The programs will be under other departments.

209
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,360
Why can't that work?

210
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,800
There aren't there other agencies.

211
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,000
There's often duplication in the federal government.

212
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,480
What is it that you think will happen if they move to these other departments?

213
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,920
First, we have not had any transparency.

214
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,240
The fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said, quote-unquote

215
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,520
critical programs would be moved.

216
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,360
There's been no information at this point about which programs will continue, which ones

217
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,360
might be eliminated and where they're going.

218
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,200
Secondly, with less than half the staff, it will be nearly impossible to implement these

219
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
programs.

220
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,480
In fact, some of the agencies where these programs are being moved also were really cut

221
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,040
to the bone in terms of their staff.

222
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,800
And finally, people are incredibly concerned.

223
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:06,600
The funding that Congress allocated in mid-March has not yet gone out to the field.

224
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,960
Many of these community-based providers can last no more than two or three weeks without

225
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,920
critical federal funding before they begin to cut services or even start laying off their

226
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
own staff.

227
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,360
A lot of uncertainty right now and no information coming out from HHS about exactly what's

228
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,440
happening with these programs.

229
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,280
Allison, we have just a minute left, but I want to get a sense from you where you think

230
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,840
we will see the impact first.

231
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,320
I know a lot of food pantries might be expecting more people to show up, but these are the

232
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,720
communities where often they can't get the help, right?

233
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,160
Maybe they can't drive themselves, they can't do these other things.

234
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,680
So where do you think we're going to see this rear its head in terms of its effects on

235
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,000
everyday people?

236
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,720
I think we are going to start seeing this literally in communities across the country.

237
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:04,360
People rely every day on the one healthy meal that comes and feeds an older adult.

238
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,840
People rely every day on the person who might come in their home to help get them out

239
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,480
of bed, give them a shower, and get them out into the community.

240
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:19,320
If we don't see this funding come out soon, we will literally start seeing these life-saving

241
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,600
services reduced, and potentially people having to leave their own homes and communities

242
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,400
and enter nursing homes.

243
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,200
That's how critical the programs, the administration community living provides are to people day

244
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,360
in and day out.

245
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,560
That's Allison Barkoff, a former head of the administration for community living under

246
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,040
President Biden.

247
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,880
Straight ahead on CNN this morning, we're going to talk about the Supreme Court handing

248
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,240
the Trump administration a big win, basically allowing deportations to continue under the

249
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,080
Alien Enemies Act with one distinct condition.

250
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,640
Plus, it is in drinking water all across the country, fluoride.

251
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,480
That might not be the case for long.

252
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,640
The new season of United States of Skandal has bribery, fraud, undercover agents, and

253
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,960
politician suffering from a moral virus, you know, the usual.

254
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:26,080
United States of Skandal with Jake Tapper, Sunday at 9 on CNN.

255
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,920
It scares the devil out of me.

256
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
We have a choice.

257
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,200
We can pay the bills or raise prices or try and absorb them and go out to business.

258
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,720
Businesses in the U.S. that rely on imports from China now scrambling as President Trump

259
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,440
threatens to hike tariffs on China again.

260
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Good morning everybody.

261
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
I'm Audit Cornish.

262
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,160
I want to thank you for joining me here on CNN this morning.

263
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,440
It's half past the hour on the East Coast, and here's what's happening right now.

264
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,000
China describing President Trump's new tariffs as economic bullying and they're vowing

265
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,120
to fight to the end despite the new threat markets around the world rising.

266
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,880
U.S. futures pointing up this morning in Asian markets closing in the green.

267
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,080
And Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. wants fluoride out of our drinking

268
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
water.

269
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,520
He says he will tell the CDC to stop recommending it to communities that they add the mineral

270
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,320
to their water supply.

271
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:28,600
And CDC guidelines say fluoride is an effective and cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay.

272
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,440
The Trump administration has revoked the visas of eight more international students in

273
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,000
the past two weeks, nearly 150 students have had visas revoked.

274
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,320
The reason for their alleged involvement in campus protests is not clear that that's

275
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,320
the case in many cases.

276
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,640
Now the Supreme Court is handing the Trump administration a legal victory on its use of

277
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,480
the Alien Enemies Act.

278
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,080
In a split decision, the Justice has lifted an injunction sparked by last month's deportation

279
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,240
flights to a super prison in El Salvador.

280
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,960
The emergency appeal allows the Trump administration to continue using the law from 1798 to speed up deportations.

281
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,160
In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor calls the administration's actions a quote,

282
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,280
extraordinary threat to the rule of law.

283
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,440
President Trump and his allies see it as vindication.

284
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,160
This decision proves that President Trump and our administration have always been right

285
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,360
from the beginning.

286
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,880
He will continue to utilize the Alien Enemies Act to remove foreign terrorists.

287
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Now there's a catch.

288
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,560
The court's ruling does require the administration to give proper notice to people who may be removed.

289
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,600
We're going to talk about how some of this might work.

290
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,400
Some of the implications with my group chat and you guys this hearing today is going to

291
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,520
be before the judge, in this case, who originally put the injunction on these flights.

292
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,320
Mike Dubkey, people are in the White House obviously seeing this as vindication for the

293
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,520
use of the entire Anemies Aliens Act.

294
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,400
I'm not sure that's the case if you really read the fine print of the rulings, but what

295
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,320
does it mean to be able to talk about this as a victory?

296
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,720
I think they need to talk about this as a victory, but you're absolutely right.

297
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,880
There are now restrictions, but what they were putting forward was that the Anemies Act

298
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,080
doesn't just apply to nation-states.

299
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,040
It applies to gangs, terrorist groups, whatnot.

300
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,800
Trump was elected to lower prices.

301
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,800
He was elected to get tough on immigration and he was elected to get tough on crime.

302
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,600
This covers the efforts that they've had over the last several weeks.

303
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,320
He covers those last two items of getting tough on crime, getting tough on immigration

304
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,720
and sending a message.

305
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,800
In that sense, I think they feel like this is a positive step forward and they can continue

306
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,360
to do what they've been doing now.

307
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,120
They have some new rules and guidelines.

308
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,960
This is the way the Constitution's supposed to work.

309
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,000
So it's a victory for them, but I think it's also a victory for rule of law.

310
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,040
I think that Justice Odomayor says slightly disagrees about that.

311
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,160
I mentioned that, but we have this kind of weird split screen happening, where you have

312
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,320
the administration showing these images from that prison in El Salvador, and then you

313
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,600
have other news organizations, you have people on social media pointing to those cases

314
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,000
where people without due process are caught up in this dragnet, so to speak.

315
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,520
So as this case still works its way through the courts, we were hearing at CNN from the

316
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,440
lawyer of another person who was sent to one of these prisons, and here's what he's

317
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,400
enduring there.

318
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,880
We are gravely concerned for his safety in the sickle.

319
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,480
We know the conditions there.

320
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,760
We know that there are reports of torture, the images of Andri when he arrived there,

321
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,120
what we heard that he was crying for his mom, that he was pleading for help.

322
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,440
I can only imagine how scary this situation is for him.

323
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,880
So this is about a Venezuelan makeup artist who was swept up by the administration with

324
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,480
no hearing because of his tattoos.

325
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,760
They insist that he is a Venezuelan gang member again, because there's no day in court.

326
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
We don't know really what's going on.

327
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,160
Chuck, can you talk about how these cases affect the conversation?

328
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,720
Yeah, the American people, to Max Point, they did and want to have a safe U.S.

329
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,760
And almost everyone, including many Democrats, agree, if you come to this country and you

330
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,560
do something violent, let's see the definition of violent, you should probably be deported.

331
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,920
You should probably get your day in court, but you shouldn't be here.

332
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,000
You got an opportunity to come, but what we're learning, which is chilling, is that only

333
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
8% of the folks who actually were sent to this prison have a violent crime.

334
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,040
Only 2% have some kind of crime.

335
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,360
That includes parking tickets or speeding tickets.

336
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,280
The vast majority of these people have no criminal record here or at home.

337
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,240
And this does not make it right to send packed people who had violent crimes.

338
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,680
You should send them back.

339
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,360
We are talking about a day in court, just to make sure innocent folks and God forbid an

340
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,440
American citizen or somebody here is here illegally.

341
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,120
It may be a temporary status, but there's lots and lots of immigrants that came here.

342
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,560
Like my family came here who paid taxes, who obeyed by law, because you have to remember

343
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,880
that our immigration system has been broken for a very, very long time.

344
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,400
It's not like when my grandparents came and you just signed in at the border and you got

345
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,240
to come in, there's this long extensive process that makes it almost impossible to come

346
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
into this country.

347
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
Right.

348
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
That's why you saw people coming.

349
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,480
Jumping in here, the CPB1 app, the Biden administration allegedly put in place so that

350
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,000
people could make appointments just so they could go through the process and now that's

351
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,520
being revoked and those people are being told to go home.

352
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,840
So Jackie, as this reaches further and further into the world of people who are trying to

353
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:59,840
do things legally or getting caught up, what could the ripple effects be?

354
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,560
So I think that there has been, you know, a chilling effect about people trying to come

355
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,360
into this country, we've seen some of those numbers drop, but really just going back

356
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
to this case.

357
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:17,080
I think that this also proves the administration is taking this as a way to consolidate executive

358
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,800
power, which is something that they've really been exerting since this administration came

359
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,600
into being.

360
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,520
But the due process piece is going to be critical and you would assume that the president's

361
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,760
lawyers follow it because the Supreme Court handed it down, but we'll have to wait and

362
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,720
see that that's a big question.

363
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Yeah.

364
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
And not going away.

365
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
The Supreme Court will be back in a moment.

366
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,800
I'm going to move on to some international news because there was a surprising announcement

367
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,120
from President Trump.

368
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,240
The U.S. and Iran, he claims are already engaged in talks over the country's nuclear program.

369
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,520
Iranian state media reports that their country's foreign minister will meet with a U.S. special

370
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,840
envoy for the Middle East, Steve Wicoff and Oman on Saturday.

371
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:09,600
I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious.

372
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,080
And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with or frankly that Israel

373
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,280
wants to be involved with if they can avoid it.

374
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,320
So we're going to see if we can avoid it.

375
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,680
But it's getting to be very dangerous to it.

376
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,640
So the last publicly known time that the U.S. and Iran held direct senior-level talks

377
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
was a decade ago.

378
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,400
Joining me now is Holly Dagress, senior fellow at the Washington Institute.

379
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Welcome to CNN this morning.

380
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,680
We reached out to you because on Twitter you were talking about how Iran needs a deal

381
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,360
because it is in a dire situation on the ground, right?

382
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,960
Over time sanctions have had their intended effect.

383
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,760
So does that mean it is willing to come to the table?

384
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,440
Adi, thank you for having me on the program.

385
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,720
Well, I think it's not just sanctions that has had its intended effect.

386
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,960
It's actually mismanagement and corruption as well on the part of the Islamic Republic.

387
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,160
And I think that the situation we've seen in Iran for the past few years has suggested

388
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,160
that it's not just a dire economic situation, but that the people are very discontent

389
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,280
to the point that they've been wanting the Islamic Republic gone.

390
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,840
And that's why we saw the 2022 Women Life Freedom uprising happen.

391
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,320
And so I'm given the developments on the ground with the economy,

392
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,200
the discontent from the people, and of course the region,

393
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,760
they are desperate for some kind of economic reprieve

394
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,960
that will help them float for the next four years.

395
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,120
And that's what they're hoping to get through these potential talks

396
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,240
that if they lead to something.

397
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,840
You were talking about how things have changed in the region.

398
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,480
I'm thinking about some military changes like the New York Times,

399
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,840
but at this way they were saying that Iran has lost the air defenses

400
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,440
around its key nuclear sites because of precise Israeli strikes since last October.

401
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,520
And Iran can no longer rely on its proxy forces in the Middle East,

402
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,440
of course, thinking about Syria, et cetera.

403
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,120
So this is this perilous moment militarily as well.

404
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,440
Can you put that in context for us?

405
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,880
Sure, of course, last year we had two tit-for-tat strikes

406
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,200
between Iran and Israel.

407
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,160
Israel had taken out these air defense in Iran.

408
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,000
And what we're seeing is that in just the past few weeks,

409
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,960
U.S. President Donald Trump had sent a letter calling for talks.

410
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,800
And from what we've heard from various sources is that he said,

411
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,240
if you don't do these talks, that there will be some sort of military action

412
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,360
against Iran and that they had a two-month deadline.

413
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,880
And of course, Iran had responded that they would want to indirect talks.

414
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,080
And that's what we've been seeing is actually this potato-potato moment,

415
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,440
which is, are these indirect talks, are these indirect talks?

416
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,240
But at the end of the day, these are talks.

417
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,360
And so that's what's supposed to be happening the Saturday and Oman.

418
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,400
But one thing I want to ask you before I let you go,

419
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,720
which is that there's distrust, obviously, between both countries.

420
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,720
But the U.S. also pulled out of that nuclear deal under Trump.

421
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,120
So is Iran going to the table kind of, yeah, concerned about that?

422
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,000
Does that affect this negotiation going forward?

423
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,080
Well, as you know, the U.S.

424
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,120
which you from the JCPOA in 2018, despite not violating the deal at the time

425
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,480
under the first Trump administration.

426
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,760
And believe it or not, if you remember the talks between Zelensky and Trump just weeks ago,

427
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,800
when that fell apart at the White House, the Iranians were actually quick to react.

428
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,600
There was a billboard in Tehran that basically had the picture of the talk

429
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
and it said lessons from Ukraine.

430
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,960
In an essence, it was saying that we shouldn't trust the United States.

431
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,520
So what you're actually going to be seeing is a bit of a divide

432
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,680
on if these talks should even be happening domestically inside Iran

433
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:56,960
because there are groups in Iran that believe that the United States should never be trusted.

434
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,160
But in this situation, there's going to be a push for talks

435
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,640
because of this situation on the ground.

436
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,360
And they realize that they need some sort of band-aid just to keep a float

437
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,200
to survive the next four years of the Trump administration.

438
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,840
Holly Degress is a senior fellow at the Washington Institute talking to us there

439
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,920
about Iran. Appreciate your time.

440
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,120
Coming up on CNN this morning, we're going to be talking tariff tension

441
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,680
because it is hitting investors and small business owners.

442
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,160
Congressman Chuck Edwards is here.

443
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,160
His constituents with North Carolina are trying to cope with this trade war

444
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,600
while recovering from the effects of a hurricane.

445
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,640
Plus, college basketball crowns and new national champion,

446
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,160
we have the latest from San Antonio.

447
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,680
They've won, they can't touch it.

448
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,320
They can't, won't suck it.

449
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,720
As tariff fears Grip Wall Street, main street is, of course, taking a hit.

450
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,360
Small business owners still reeling from billions of dollars in losses.

451
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,040
For example, from Hurricane Helene and Western North Carolina.

452
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,000
Now tariffs are bringing a new threat to that recovery.

453
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,520
Right now we're under serious strain from tariffs, especially on aluminum.

454
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,000
Most of our BR is put in cans.

455
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,320
And our aluminum prices have increased 17% this calendar year

456
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,880
and are expected to grow even higher.

457
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,400
Absorbing these costs is simply not feasible without raising prices.

458
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,080
These tariffs are pouring salt and a wound that is just now beginning to heal.

459
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,400
I wanted to talk about this because these voices are from North Carolina.

460
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,760
So here is the Republican Congressman Chuck Edwards of North Carolina.

461
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,440
His district, of course, was hit by Helene last year.

462
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,720
Congressman, thank you for being here with me this morning.

463
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,800
Yeah, good morning. Thanks for having me.

464
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,000
So we heard there some small business owners speaking out,

465
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,840
saying specifically, this is how this is going to hurt us.

466
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,080
And then recently we heard from one of your state's Republican senators,

467
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,160
Tom Tilles, who said this about how tariffs might impact farmers in your state.

468
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,400
Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right,

469
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,160
need to talk about farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy.

470
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,440
They don't have time.

471
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,800
So we've got to be crisp on this implementation.

472
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,120
Otherwise, we can do damage since they're reputable to farmers and businesses.

473
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,240
So the senator is actually pushing a bill in the Senate signing onto a bill

474
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,480
that would rein in the president's tariff power.

475
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,240
Is that something you think the house should consider as well?

476
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,800
Is it something you would sign on to have given the chance?

477
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,520
No, I certainly would not sign on to that theory.

478
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,120
I believe that our president was very clear when he asked to be our president,

479
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,080
that he'd be using tariffs to make America more competitive.

480
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,280
I trust that he will do exactly that.

481
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,400
I know that there's just a lot of angst out there right now,

482
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,640
but we're really early into this process.

483
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,080
These lawmakers are responding to their constituents.

484
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,720
What are you telling these people who say,

485
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,560
look, I am genuinely worried.

486
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,200
I cannot wait until the economy bottoms out

487
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,680
or for manufacturing to be brought back to the US a decades-long process.

488
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,920
Well, the tariff announcements are really young.

489
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,440
We're only into a few days ago they were announced.

490
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,200
I believe that we need to give president the opportunity to bring world leaders

491
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,880
to the table and begin to have discussions

492
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,880
on what we need, what the United States needs from them

493
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,960
to create a more fair and balanced trade atmosphere.

494
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,440
I've got the full confidence that that's exactly what he's going to be able to do.

495
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,440
I believe the American people have full confidence.

496
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,520
They elected President Trump widespread in this country

497
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,200
based on the fact that he told us he'd be leveraging tariffs

498
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,520
to make us more competitive.

499
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,840
I want to talk about the lumber industry,

500
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,200
the US is planning on hiking existing duties

501
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,840
on Canadian lumber up to 34%.

502
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,320
I know lumber exports are a big deal in North Carolina,

503
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,280
so you're going to be facing reciprocal tariffs on that.

504
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,720
And it could also raise basically home-building materials,

505
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,440
raising the average cost of a home by potentially more than $9,000.

506
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,960
Is there anything that you're worried about when it comes to impacts

507
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,400
on people who are in the middle of trying to rebuild after the hurricane?

508
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,200
Yeah, certainly we're all concerned about our world economy right now.

509
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,240
But we have a president that has the courage to stand out in front of the world

510
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,760
and use America's might, not only our military might,

511
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,040
but our economic might to convince the rest of the world

512
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,960
to enter into fair trade agreements.

513
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,320
The announcement of tariffs is only the beginning of this process.

514
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,080
We know that President Trump is the great negotiator.

515
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,560
He's the author of the art of the deal.

516
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,440
I certainly believe that he's trying to create leverage right now

517
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,080
and say to the rest of the world

518
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,000
that America is going to grow our economy.

519
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,600
And can you, Congressman, can I jump in here?

520
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,800
Leverage for what?

521
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
It's not clear.

522
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,040
We've heard multiple reasons for the tariffs.

523
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,400
No consistency in the way they're applied.

524
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,840
We were earlier looking at a report out of Russia

525
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,400
where lawmakers there were joking around about the fact

526
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,600
that Russia wasn't facing tariffs.

527
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,240
I think people are trying to make sense of this

528
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,160
and they're having a hard time hearing back

529
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,680
from their representatives.

530
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,360
Trust us, it's going to work out.

531
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,920
Well, let's look back at President Trump's 40th.

532
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,880
His first term when he was...

533
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,240
We know he likes tariffs.

534
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,120
We just don't know what this is supposed to accomplish

535
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,080
and in what time frame and for what specific reasons.

536
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,400
So, again, let's look back while he was our 45th president.

537
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,400
He negotiated deals with countries like Canada and Mexico

538
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,400
using the leverage of tariffs that those countries

539
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,600
in return for us lowering tariffs would

540
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,600
purchase more American agricultural products and goods.

541
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,320
Unfortunately, he did not become the 46th president

542
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,120
and President Biden did not enforce those agreements.

543
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,440
I believe that we're in a position now

544
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,720
where foreign leaders will take him very seriously

545
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,440
and they'll meet up to the agreements

546
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,520
that are ultimately to be made.

547
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,880
The announcement of tariffs is just the beginning.

548
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,440
The real benefit comes after the negotiation,

549
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,760
after foreign leaders come to the table.

550
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,920
Now, I believe that we should get President Trump

551
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,800
the opportunity to bring them to the table.

552
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,920
And yes, we should watch what's taking place

553
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,160
with a great deal of scrutiny, but at this point,

554
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I believe that we need to trust the President.

555
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,120
Congressman Chuck Edwards of North Carolina.

556
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,320
We're going to switch gears now because finally,

557
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,520
the madness is over.

558
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,320
The Florida Gators are the last team standing.

559
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,720
One second, and it's over.

560
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,080
Florida is back on top of the college basketball world.

561
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,080
Florida overcoming a smothering Houston defense

562
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,280
and a 12-point second half deficit

563
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,400
to beat the Cougar 65 to 63 last night.

564
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,520
What does this win mean for you and Gator Nation?

565
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,080
Obviously, we're thrilled, man.

566
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,360
It's a heck of a moment, an incredible opportunity to be here.

567
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,880
And the fact that we finished it up means everything in the world.

568
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,960
I'm joined by CNN contributor, Carrie Champion,

569
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,920
and CNN Sports Anchor, Koi Wire.

570
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,760
I know you guys both watch this closely.

571
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,320
Koi, I'm bringing you because you were up in the mix.

572
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,680
We just saw at the end.

573
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,360
And Carrie, I'm bringing you back because you were like,

574
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,800
Duke's going to take it.

575
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,240
So, first, I just have to get your point of view on where we stand now,

576
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,480
because that did not work out for many reasons.

577
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
But how are you feeling about the game you saw?

578
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,800
Is that from your point?

579
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,600
That's for you, Carrie.

580
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,320
Too soon!

581
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,960
I mean, it's fine.

582
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,920
I will take the L.

583
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
I'm sure I was like millions of others

584
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,200
who thought Duke would win.

585
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,520
Congratulations to Houston for getting past Duke.

586
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,200
And then I thought Houston would take it all.

587
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,800
So, what I'm feeling right now,

588
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,200
if I'm honest with you, Sarah Cider's going to be insufferable,

589
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,640
because her Florida Gators won,

590
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,440
but they just conferred just a few minutes.

591
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,680
Their defense did in the end,

592
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,000
which is pretty ironic, because Houston is no further defense.

593
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,960
But congratulations.

594
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,760
They did a good job.

595
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Koi, I'll let you have the stage since.

596
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,320
I love that she reminded everyone I had it wrong.

597
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,400
I didn't do it.

598
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,600
That was the girl already.

599
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,360
I mean, I mean, she said it.

600
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,080
Incredible win for Gator Nation.

601
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,840
I mean, this was their first championship in 18 years.

602
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,320
And we're talking about a very storied program.

603
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,280
If you look back when they won,

604
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,520
they're back-to-back titles in 06 and 07.

605
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,360
And the way they won is the most important thing here,

606
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
because this was one of the top three offenses

607
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,320
in the nation all year,

608
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,080
but Carrie mentioned that,

609
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,800
suffering Cougars defense.

610
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,280
And that was the first time the Cougars lost all year

611
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,000
when holding an opponent to under 70 points.

612
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But the Gators still find a way to win.

613
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,680
Their star was shut down.

614
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,720
Walter Clayton had zero points in the first half,

615
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,480
but his teammates rallied up.

616
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,240
They rise up around him,

617
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,560
and they find a way to get it done with grit,

618
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,680
with toughness,

619
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,240
walking off the stage there with coach at the end,

620
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,920
literally walking him up the court

621
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,840
for the first time as a national champion.

622
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,520
It was absolute elation.

623
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
And he's now the youngest coach

624
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,080
to win a national title in 42 years.

625
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,440
He's just 39 years old,

626
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,120
and I think they've got a pretty good,

627
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,760
dark thing cooking down there in Gainesville.

628
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
And Carrie, you know, while I have you,

629
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,000
I also want to talk about the women's champions

630
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,920
with Yukon back on top again.

631
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,440
Why are they so dominant?

632
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,720
What does this moment sort of say about that team?

633
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,200
Yeah, we were in Tampa this weekend for the final four.

634
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,000
I will say this.

635
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,600
Geno Arem, say what you want about him.

636
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,000
He is by far one of the best coaches

637
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,640
to ever do with.

638
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,880
They have 12 national championships.

639
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,920
And the reason why that program is that way is because of him.

640
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,760
He created it 40 years of coaching.

641
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,160
And this is the fiber of that type of team

642
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,920
and that organization.

643
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,480
He's been able to put together such a good program.

644
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,040
And I have to give him all of the credit,

645
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,320
because people decide where they want to go.

646
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,360
And usually they pick Yukon because of what it's known for.

647
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,800
And he's bringing that glory back.

648
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,560
You see him hugging page beckers here.

649
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,680
Page, this is her last year in college.

650
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,600
And I thought it was a beautiful Cinderella story

651
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,200
because she had to fight through injury.

652
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,560
She was the number one in her class in 2020.

653
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,840
And she watched all of her teammates just go away

654
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,240
into the WNBA and do well.

655
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,280
And so now I'm just really, really happy for what I would think

656
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,240
is an appropriate ending for a college superstar

657
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,880
and for Geno Arem and his program.

658
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,200
All right, Carrie, champion and coi wire,

659
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,800
bringing me a little joy this morning

660
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,080
because it's a rough news day.

661
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,720
Thanks you guys.

662
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,120
I know, I know.

663
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,760
Thank you, Adi.

664
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,200
All right.

665
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
We're going to talk about what we're keeping an eye on

666
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,160
in the news now.

667
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,880
And I'm going to bring it back to the group.

668
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,480
Jackie, can I start with you?

669
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,560
What are you watching out for the next day or two?

670
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,080
There our page in here was invited

671
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,280
to testify a part of Bill Cassidy's help committee this week.

672
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,160
I'm clear, rather, he's going to accept that invitation.

673
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,840
But, you know, what does this mean for Oversight

674
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,240
of that very critical agency that he leads?

675
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,480
Yeah, a lawmaker who was very skeptical

676
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,000
during those hearings.

677
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,960
Chuck, how about you?

678
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm keeping an eye on the stock futures.

679
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,480
Is it going to go up?

680
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,360
Is it going to go down?

681
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,400
It's another rollercoaster day.

682
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,720
But the thing I'm really keeping my eye on is Ted Cruz

683
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,800
because I blame you for my Houston Cougars

684
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,840
losing last night.

685
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,680
Every time you show up at a sporting event

686
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,520
for Texas team, we lose.

687
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,440
And I am bitter and it's your fault.

688
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,920
Yeah, I'm not sure that's how sports work,

689
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,440
but I am new.

690
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,040
I promise you it is.

691
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,160
My last word to you.

692
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,360
All right, that is exactly how sports works.

693
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,960
It's all about superstition.

694
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,000
So, let's go there.

695
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,120
Fair, fair, fair.

696
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,320
I'm in fact checked.

697
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,280
I like it.

698
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,440
I'm looking at the seven senators

699
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,480
who put their names forward of Republican senators

700
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,680
on the bipartisan Trade Review Act of 2025.

701
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,840
I'm looking to see who the next six are.

702
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Because while President Trump has a high threshold for pain,

703
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,440
there's not really a lot of profiles

704
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,120
and courage of the 535 members of Congress.

705
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,040
And several of these people, I think,

706
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,680
are going to step forward Republicans

707
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,120
and put their name to that.

708
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,440
If the stock market continues to go down

709
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,000
or if we have some bad economic messaging.

710
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,520
So, I'm waiting to see where they get to 60.

711
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,440
I know Trump will veto it.

712
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,760
But let's see who joins those seven

713
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,560
who have already signed down on the Republican side.

714
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,320
All right, thanks to the group chat and things

715
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,840
to you for waking up with us.

716
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,720
I'm Adi Cornish and CNN New Central starts right now.

717
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:31,400
This week on the assignment with me, Adi Cornish.

718
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,640
There are reports of at least a dozen students and faculty

719
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,440
who have been detained by federal agents.

720
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,560
How does this happen?

721
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,800
How can the government detain legal immigrants

722
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,000
without charges?

723
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,560
How is this affecting students and faculty

724
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,640
at campuses around the country?

725
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,800
And who is challenging the government

726
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,360
over potential First Amendment violations

727
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,600
for punishing people who say things

728
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,840
that the administration labels a threat?

729
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,640
