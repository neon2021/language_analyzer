1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You just said something that's like very important can't be dogmatic when you're talking about vaccines or about anything.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes it is good to keep an open mind isn't it and be flexible and look at a 360 degree view of things rather than your tunnel vision

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and what you're indoctrinated into isn't it?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah and especially if you know that indoctrination has been on purpose and profitable.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
One of the great things about your book is first of all your book is called dissolving illusions.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I know I've talked about on the podcast a bunch of times but you also highlight a lot of things that we know are beneficial

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that somehow or another get lumped into nonsense like even cinnamon.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Cinnamon is a powerful herb actually and it's known to be helpful in glucose handling for a lot of diabetics taking it in capsule form now.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I noticed at the end of my nephrology career that a lot of my own patients were taking cinnamon capsules but it's also has a lot of vitamin C in it

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and I think that was probably one of the keys.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A lot of those old remedies that we wrote about the magic and then probably was the vitamin C in them.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I dismissed all that stuff as total nonsense.
