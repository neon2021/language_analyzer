00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 hello lovely students and welcome back to english with lucy a few weeks ago i made a video about

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 ordering a coffee in advanced c1 c2 english if you watched that video you probably thought

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 lucy can't take this any further but then i started thinking and my mind turned to mcdonald's

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 as it sometimes does when i'm really hungry i thought to myself could i possibly take this

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 concept and make a video about ordering at mcdonald's in super advanced english how far

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 could i possibly take this oh students have i got a treat for you today before we start i want to

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 remind you that as always there is a free pdf that goes with this lesson i think you're going to like

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 it because we go into c1 english in great detail and we include a lot of extra information on the

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 grammar i'm also going to go through a lot of the advanced vocabulary in this video but the video

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 would be too long so i'm going to go through a lot of the advanced vocabulary in this video but the

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 video would be too long so i'm going to go through a lot of the advanced vocabulary in this video but

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 long if i went through it all so i've put all of the words and phrases i talk about plus more in

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 that pdf you are going to love it if you'd like to download that just click on the link in the

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 okay let's get started and i need to

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 address the comment that i anticipate in the comment section lucy no one orders in mcdonald's

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 like this you're right people don't order from mcdonald's like this and i said in my video about

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 ordering a coffee that someone would probably spit in my drink if i ordered like that and the same

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 is true here don't do this to the workers in mcdonald's but today's video is jam-packed with

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 super advanced vocabulary and grammar structures that we do genuinely use just not necessarily in

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 this context and i think it's such a fun way to learn them i also have homework for you

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 at the end of this lesson when you've learnt all the advanced ways of ordering at mcdonald's

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 i want you to do your go-to order at mcdonald's in a comment make it as advanced as you possibly

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 can it's going to be hilarious i can't wait to read them okay we have five levels today

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 let's start with level one can i have a cheeseburger medium fries and a large

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 coke please you could also use could or may so this is actually how i would

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 at McDonald's.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Now, I covered the differences

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 between using the different modal verbs

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 in my video about ordering a coffee.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So if you're interested, go and watch that.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 But you might notice that I ordered fries and not chips,

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 even though in the UK, we normally say chips.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 In McDonald's, we go American and we ask for fries.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 We also order Coke, as short for Coca-Cola.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 We never tend to say cola.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 That's just like an off-brand name to us.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We're also often asked eat in or take away,

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 meaning are you eating in the restaurant

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 or taking the food somewhere else?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 This is really important because we have different tacks.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 It's cheaper to eat food out of a restaurant

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 than inside a restaurant.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 In the US, you're more likely to hear eat in or to go.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So that's my first order, level one, nice and simple.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Now let's move it up a notch, get a bit more advanced.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Level two, what I'd love is a well-done cheeseburger

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 with a finely sliced, perfectly melted piece of cheese

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 and a dab of cheese.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 A dab of ketchup, freshly made, lightly salted fries

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 and a large Coke with two cubes

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 of almost defrosted ice, please.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 There's a 20% chance they're gonna spit

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 in my food at this point.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Okay, first I want to touch on the grammar.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 It started with a cleft sentence.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I love cleft sentences.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 What I'd love is, what I'd love is.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Instead of saying I'd love a, what I'd love is.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 How cool is that?

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Okay, we use cleft sentences to place the emphasis

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 on a certain part.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And in this case, I was emphasising a well-done cheeseburger.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 That brings me to the next grammar point, well-done.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Compound adjectives.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Compound adjectives are adjectives

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 that have two or more words acting as one single descriptor.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Here are some examples from the text.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 We have well-done, finely sliced, perfectly melted,

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 freshly made, lightly salted, well-done, finely sliced.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And almost defrosted.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Now, as you can see, I can preempt this question

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 in your head right now.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Some are separated by hyphens and others are not.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Why is this?

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Well, we often hyphenate compound adjectives

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 when they come before a noun.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 However, we don't hyphenate compound adjectives

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 when the first word ends in ly, l-y.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 We talk a lot more about compound adjectives

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 in my C1 programme.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 By the way, if you didn't know

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 that I run an online B1, B2, and C1 programme,

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I've got links to them in the description box,

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 or you can just visit englishwithlucy.com

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 and see all the information.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Next, I have two pieces of vocabulary

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 that I want to touch on.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I asked for a dab of ketchup.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 A dab is a small amount of something

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 that is put on a surface quickly.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 I dab on makeup, for example,

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 and I wanted a dab of ketchup, just a little bit.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I also wanted the ice cubes,

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 almost defrosted, okay?

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 To defrost means to become warmer,

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 so it's not frozen anymore.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Finally, I want to talk about the punctuation

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I used in that sentence.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Did you notice that I used semicolons

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 to separate the items in my order?

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 We can use semicolons to separate items in a list

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 if at least one of the items already contains a comma.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 These two items had commas, as you can see.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Semicolons are really good

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 at helping avoid confusion in long lists.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Okay.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 My order was quite advanced,

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 but I know I can go a little bit further.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Let's start with level three.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 If I may, I would like to ask for a well-done burger

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 topped with a piece of cheese

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 that is on the point of melting,

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 a hint of gherkin, and just a dollop of ketchup.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I've also got a craving for some gently salted fries

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 with a golden hue,

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 though under no circumstances should they be burnt,

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 and nothing would quench my thirst more

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 than a Coke with crushed ice.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Okay, I'm not gonna lie,

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 that actually sounds absolutely delicious.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Insufferable, but delicious.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 First, I want to talk about the structure

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I used to begin my order.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 If I may.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 This is a very polite way to begin or end a request.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I'd love a cookie, if I may.

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Next, there are two grammatical structures

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 that I want to talk about.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 The first one is on the point of,

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 and this is a phrase to express

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 that something is about to happen

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 in the very near future,

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 on the point of melting,

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I'm just about to melt.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Another structure in this sentence,

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 under no circumstances should they be burnt.

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Wow, that does sound really advanced.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 We do use this structure though, we do.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 What do you notice about the word order here?

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 This sentence contains another of my favourites.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 I can't choose between cleft sentences and inversion.

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Inversion is when the verb comes before the subject.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Should they?

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 But it's not a question.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It's an example of inversion,

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 after a negative and verbial, under no circumstances.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Again, in my C1 course,

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 we have a whole section on cleft sentences and inversion.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Now, for some vocabulary.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I asked for a hint of gherkin.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 A hint is a very small amount of something,

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 and a gherkin is a small cucumber

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 that is preserved in vinegar.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 There is a building in London

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 that everyone calls the gherkin

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 because it looks like a gherkin.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Did you guess that?

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 You might already know

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 the American English word for this, which is pickle.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Pickle for us, although we would understand you

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 depending on context,

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 but pickle for us is more like chutney,

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 something that you serve with cheese.

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 A cheese and pickle sandwich is very popular

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 and there are no gherkins in sight.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 That's cheese and chutney more than anything.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Next, craving.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 A craving is a strong desire for something.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Pregnant women often talk about their cravings.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 So weird.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 My most consumed fruit is Granny Smith apples.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And only recently,

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I found out that my mum had cravings for Granny Smith apples

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 when she was pregnant with me.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 That has to be connected.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Another word was hue,

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 which means a colour or a shade of a colour.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And finally, I talked about quenching my thirst.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 To quench one's thirst means to drink

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 until one doesn't feel thirsty anymore.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Some gorgeous vocabulary there.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Now let's try level four,

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 and we're still not at the end yet.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Might I request a burger constructed

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 of a char-grilled patty, a sliver of cheese,

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 that is more sharp than pungent,

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 a gherkin with a bit of a bite, and a dab of ketchup?

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 That should be served in a lightly toasted bun

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 with a smattering of sesame seeds.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I've also got a hankering for a generous serving of fries,

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 which should be nicely crispy.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 In fact, so crispy should they be,

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 that I would like to hear a delicate crunch

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 as I bite into each one.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I'll top all of that off

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 with an ice cold glass of Coke, please.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Okay, I draw the line at this one.

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 I'm going to have to go.

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Okay. I'm going to have to go.

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 What an annoying customer.

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Honestly, I would actually like to witness somebody

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 try this at a McDonald's.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I'd love to see the response.

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Now let's look at the language.

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 First, I started with might I request.

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 This is a very polite way to say,

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 can I ask for, or can I have.

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 We don't tend to use it with please.

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 You wouldn't say please might I request.

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Might I request, or please could I request,

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 but not together.

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I also used an advanced comparative structure.

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 More sharp,

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 than pungent.

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 More sharp,

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 than pungent.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 To compare two similar qualities,

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 we often use more,

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 plus adjective,

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 plus than,

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 plus adjective.

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 So I essentially wanted it to be sharp,

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 not pungent.

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I also used inversion,

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 my favourite again.

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 So crispy should they be that.

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So crispy should they be that,

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 et cetera, et cetera.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 We use inversion when we have so,

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 plus an adjectival or adverbial phrase,

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 at the beginning of a sentence for emphasis.

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 We could rewrite it like this.

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 They should be so crispy that.

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 That also makes perfect sense,

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 but the other one just sounds,

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 whoa, a little bit more artful.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Now, vocabulary.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 There was some really good vocabulary in this.

243
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I asked for a char-grilled patty.

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 To char-grill means to cook something over a high heat,

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 so that its surface is slightly burnt,

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 adding a lot of flavour.

247
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And a patty is a piece of food made into a circular shape,

248
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 a raw burger shape.

249
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 That's a patty.

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Patty is more common in American English,

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 but it's making its way into British English too,

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 because we don't have very good food.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 So we have to welcome it in from other cultures.

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 The next two were about cheese,

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 sharp and pungent.

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Sharp means strong and a little bit kind of sour or bitter.

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 It almost stings your tongue a little bit.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Pungent means having a very strong taste or smell.

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It normally implies a negative smell,

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 unless you're talking about cheese,

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 where a strong smell is expected.

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I also wanted a smattering of sesame seeds on my burger bun.

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 I can't say that word without smiling.

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Smattering, it's so good.

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 A smattering means a small number or amount.

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And finally, I used the phrase to have a hankering for.

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 My mum uses this all the time.

268
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 You can also use it to say, oh, I'm hungry.

269
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 You can use it in a phrasal verb format,

270
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 to hanker after, to hanker after something.

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Both of those mean to have a strong want

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 or desire for something.

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 I have a hankering for chocolate.

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Okay, number five, level five.

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 This is as advanced as we're going to get.

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 This is the height of my powers, okay?

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Are you ready?

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Because I don't think I am.

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Were it not for my intense craving,

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I wouldn't be so specific.

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 However, I would adore a cheeseburger,

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 a burger bun.

283
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 A burger made from meat that has been tenderised by hand

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 before being fried.

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 On top of that, I would like some tart cheese,

286
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 a smidgen of mustard, a trace of ketchup,

287
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 and a perfectly round slice of gherkin.

288
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 All of that should be in a bun,

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 encrusted with sesame seeds.

290
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 On the side, I'd like some fries,

291
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 which are to have been cooked to a perfect crisp

292
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 and dusted with salt.

293
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And finally, I'm going to abstain from drinking anything

294
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 as I don't want to ruin my taste buds.

295
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'm officially insufferable.

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Before you throw your phone or your laptop out of the window,

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 let's look at the language.

298
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Then you can.

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Actually, I'm not giving you permission to do that.

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 That could end in a lawsuit.

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I began this order with a conditional sentence,

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 which was another version of inversion.

303
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Oh, that sounds good.

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Another version of inversion.

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Another example of inversion.

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 It's a combination.

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Everywhere today.

308
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Were it not for, I wouldn't be.

309
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Were it not for, I wouldn't be.

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Now, this is a second conditional

311
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 in which the if has been omitted,

312
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 making the sentence more formal.

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I talk about advanced conditional clauses

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 in my C1 program in great detail.

315
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I also used a perfect passive infinitive structure.

316
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I'd like some fries, which are to have been cooked.

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I must say we don't tend to use this much in spoken English,

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 which are to have been cooked.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 This is the structured be plus to have been

320
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 plus the past participle.

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I use the passive here

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 because I don't know who will cook the fries.

323
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Finally, some vocabulary, tart.

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Tart, meaning tasting sour or having a bitter taste.

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Be careful with the noun version here.

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 We can have a tart, which is an open pie

327
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 normally filled with fruit or sweet food.

328
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And we also have a derogatory word.

329
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 If you call someone a tart, well, firstly, don't.

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Don't call someone a tart.

331
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 A tart is a derogatory term

332
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 for a woman showing her sexuality,

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 maybe dressing in a way that someone feels is inappropriate

334
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 or overtly sexual.

335
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 The adjective of that is tarty.

336
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 I don't recommend you to use it,

337
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 but important that you understand it.

338
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Next, we have smidgen, smidgen.

339
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And this means a small piece or amount of something.

340
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I want just a smidgen of wasabi with my sushi.

341
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 We also have encrusted, encrusted,

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 which means covered with something hard.

343
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 We often talk about a diamond-encrusted crown

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 or a bracelet that was encrusted with gemstones.

345
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 We have to dust.

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 So to dust can mean to remove dust from somewhere.

347
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 It's a verb for cleaning.

348
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 But in this context,

349
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 it means to cover something with a powdery substance.

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 We dust cake with icing sugar,

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 which is called powdered sugar in American English.

352
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 That's something I learned recently, actually,

353
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 through following American English.

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And finally, we have to abstain, to abstain.

355
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 This means to not do something,

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 especially something pleasurable

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 that is bad for your health or wrong in some way.

358
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Okay, what did you think of my orders?

359
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I think only the first one would be truly acceptable.

360
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 In a McDonald's.

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 The next four would probably, yeah,

362
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 not have a good outcome for me if I did that.

363
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Don't forget about your homework.

364
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 I want you to write your homework

365
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 or go to McDonald's order in the comment section

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 and go as advanced as you possibly can.

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And don't be afraid of making mistakes.

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 It's fine.

369
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 This is really, really advanced.

370
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 So many native speakers would not be able

371
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 to explain their use of these structures

372
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 and some wouldn't even use them correctly.

373
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Just go for it and have some fun.

374
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And I'll keep my eyes peeled.

375
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I'll be looking in the comment section

376
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 to see who takes it to extremes.

377
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 You can also use the PDF to help you.

378
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And if you want to download that,

379
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 click on the link in the description box.

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I've loved today's lesson.

381
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 It was ridiculous and fun.

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And if you would like another one like this in the future,

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 please give me some ideas.

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 We've done coffee.

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 We've done the daily routine.

386
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 We've done McDonald's.

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 We've done all these things.

388
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 What next?

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 What would you like me to take to extremes for you?

390
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And don't forget to check out my amazing English programmes.

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 They are 12 week programmes.

392
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 We have B1, B2 and C1.

393
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 You can see them all at englishwithlucy.com.

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Thousands and thousands of students have taken my programmes.

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Here are some comments

396
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 from students that enrolled in all three programmes.

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I must point out Pierre Olivier here

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 because he writes so incredibly beautifully.

399
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And when I received his testimonial,

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I just thought I have to put that in an advanced lesson.

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I'd love to have you join them.

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I will see you soon for another lesson.

403
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Bye.
