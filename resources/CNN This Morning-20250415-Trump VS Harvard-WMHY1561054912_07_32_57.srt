1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Good morning, it's Tuesday, April 15th, and here's what's happening right now on CNN This Morning.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 This is literally political ransom.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 The White House standoff with America's wealthiest university, Harvard, says it's not budging, even with billions of dollars on the line.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Plus, no can do. The White House says it does not have the power to bring back a man deported by accident.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 So what happens now?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Plus, tax day in America. Could your sensitive tax information soon be in the hands of Doge?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And also this.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm looking at something to help some of the car companies.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Will the auto industry be thrown a lifeline? The changes that could help some companies when it comes to tariffs.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's 6 a.m. here on the East Coast. Here is a live look at Boston this morning.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 A showdown in nearby Cambridge as the Trump administration pushes for big changes at Harvard University.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Good morning, everybody. I'm Audie Cornish. Thank you for waking up with me.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Now, since retaking the Oval Office, Donald Trump has been successful at bending U.S. institutions to his will.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Whether that's government agencies, tech companies, law firms, one way or another, they've been forced to decide whether or not they want to.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 To comply with the president's demands.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Now the Trump administration is taking the fight to America's oldest university.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 When ICE agents show up at our doors, Harvard should have our backs.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Standing up for our values comes at a cost for our future.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 But I didn't travel 5,000 miles all the way from Pakistan just to be afraid of walking five feet out of my dorm.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 It's a transparent effort to change what is taught, what we see.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 What we say in our classrooms, what we teach our students, to make sure that the only things that are actually said on university campuses are things that the Trump administration wants to hear and wants to be said.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 On Monday, the Trump administration froze more than $2 billion of Harvard's federal funding.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 That decision made after the university rejected a list of demands that the White House sent it last week.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Among those demands, an end to so-called DEI practices.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 They also want an external audit looking for, quote,

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 viewpoint diversity in everywhere from,

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 coursework to the student body itself.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And new discipline policies, including retroactive punishments, including for protests that happened two years ago.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And a comprehensive mask ban.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 The Trump administration even specified that people who wear masks should be punished with no less than suspension.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 So in a statement, Harvard's president described Trump's desired changes as a violation of the university's constitutional rights.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 But for the White House, they represented,

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 yet another chance to make good on something they've been talking about for years.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Schools that persist in explicit, unlawful discrimination under the guise of equity will not only have their endowments taxed,

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 but through budget reconciliation, I will advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 I think if any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it,

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 we have to,

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 honestly,

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 and aggressively attack the universities in this country.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Joining the group chat today, Phil Mattingly, CNN anchor and chief court domestic correspondent,

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Gabby Bierenbaum, Washington correspondent for the Nevada Independent and Kevin Frey,

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Washington correspondent for Spectrum News, New York One.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Everybody, I want to just start with what the president is trying to do,

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 because in that old clip we played, he talked about taxing endowments, which is not what he's doing, right?

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 He's specifically,

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 He's specifically,

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 He's specifically saying, here's a list of demands, comply, or I'm going after your federal funding.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 So, sort of who in the administration is pushing this?

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 What can you tell us about the thinking?

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Yeah, I mean, why slog through a legislative process that you don't know how it's going to end when you can just do it yourself?

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And I think this is so, people cannot view what's happening here in isolation, right?

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 We've been talking about this for the last several months, where the agility and kind of relentless nature with which the Trump administration and top senior advisors who have been planning for this for several years,

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 We've been talking about this for the last several months, where the agility and kind of relentless nature with which the Trump administration and top senior advisors who have been planning for this for several years,

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 have really, to your point, initially, been institutions that never saw this coming, even though Trump talked about it on the campaign trail,

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 to their will, has been something that people are just starting to kind of get their head around,

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 and Harvard being the first school to say no, is a fascinating moment to see whether this is the start of a tipping point.

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And if there's any school that can do it, it's Harvard.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 It has a massive endowment.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 No question about it.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But meanwhile, Columbia faces similar predicament, quickly caved.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Kevin, talk about the dynamics there that are different.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Right.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 I mean, look.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 They have, obviously, they were the center point of the anti-Semitism accusations early on.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and other top lawmakers in Washington have been very loudly condemning what happened there,

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 because they really became the face of the protest movement.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And that made them vulnerable to public backlash and vulnerable to political backlash.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Correct.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And you also saw those dramatic images that played out when you saw the police go onto campus and they took over the building.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And I mean, this kind of built and built and built.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And so they were already...

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 They were already under the microscope in that respect.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And then they come in and they basically comply with a lot of what the administration is looking for,

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 including sort of this mask ban and other sort of curriculum oversight, including on their Middle East Studies program.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And then on top of that, there's now conversations about whether or not there should be some sort of judicial oversight of whether or not they are in compliance.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Right.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I don't want to skip by some of the things you said.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Oversight into actual curriculum.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 So we want to tell you, or at least be able to look at what you're teaching, which is ironic since they're kind of dismantling the Ed Department.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 But they want to do this in higher ed.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Democrats and their allies coming to universities' defense.

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Here's a sense of what they've been saying.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 It's putting pressure on universities as well.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Good news is Harvard University today said go to hell.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 That may break the fever.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 I really hope it does.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 I do know this.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 If Harvard had capitulated, I really fear for what next year would be.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 There are things that matter more than simply the size of one's endowment.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 We need the presidents to be banding together and standing up for free expression.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Gabby, I probably could have stopped with Clyburn because he really lays out the stakes.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But what are you hearing in congressional delegations?

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 What are you hearing in your report?

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 What are you hearing in your reporting about people seeing this as a pivotal moment?

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I think Democrats in general have been waiting for somebody, some institution, some group to stand up and say, you know, we won't, we're not going to abide by this.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And I think Harvard, right, the big dog of academia doing it, I think we'll see.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But I would imagine gives permission for some small universities, those with endowments that aren't as large, that don't have that, you know, hundred year, multiple hundreds of years history to say we can outlast any one political moment or administration to sort of band with them.

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And I think we'll see some former Biden.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 But I also think that we'll see people who are very, very concerned about this kind of thing.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And I'm sure the legal officials have talked about law firms need to do the same, that if they stand together, it'll be easier to stand against some of this rhetoric and action coming from the Trump administration.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And so I'll see what moves forward.

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 We're going to talk about this more today.

103
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But, Phil, I just you are very good at big picture things.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And it feels like this is a moment where people are deciding, like, if you give an inch, they'll take a mile.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 So if the concern is anti-Semitism, but you let that go into also you need to wear a mat.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Also, we want to go into curriculum.

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Also, like the list just gets longer.

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And so do you think that that is the kind of thing that the public responds to,

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 that they start to see as an overreach?

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I think it converts.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Or is it still like a Harvard problem?

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 I don't know what you mean.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Like immediately, being from Boston, you know, you're just like, okay, how about them apples?

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Like you don't move forward with it thinking it's a problem.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Sound good with a hunting reference.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 No, so I think anybody who can predict how anything's going to go at this point in time

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 is probably pursuing a fool's errand.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 The one thing I would say is they have gone so long, now three plus months,

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 with little to no obstacles or tangible opponent in their face,

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 whether it's law firms, whether it's Congress, whether, you name it, across the board,

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 that at some point that was going to change.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And I think the question becomes how does the Trump administration react to this?

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Do they keep trying to just roll over people and steamroll everybody?

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Or do they start to calibrate as well?

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Terrorists was really kind of the first time they've lost their footing a little bit.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Does this start to kind of carry over?

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 The thing I would just emphasize here is this wasn't an ad hoc thing that they just decided to launch.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Stephen Miller, who has a lot of stuff on his plate as a deputy chief of staff for policy.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Russ Vogt is controlling the budget operation.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 These guys have been working in groups under the same umbrella over the course of several years,

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 planning all of this out and recognizing that it turns out, because of government funding,

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 because of government authority, that the president and the administration,

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 the executive branch, can do an awful lot in an awful lot of spaces if they just are willing to do it.

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And they are.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Create a lot of choke points.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 We're going to talk about this more today.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Coming up.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 On CNN this morning, the suspect accused of setting the Pennsylvania governor's house on fire has been arrested.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 What he told police he would have done if he saw the governor that night.

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Plus, the benefits of tech, what it could mean for your risk of dementia.

141
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And one month, that's how long a Maryland father has been in prison in El Salvador.

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Why both President Trump and El Salvador's president say they can't get him out.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I don't have the power to return him to the United States.

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Yes, you do.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 You're a dictator.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 All you have to do is dictate that he gets out of prison,

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 then go on orbits and get him a one-way ticket to Maryland.

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And his torture will be over as long as you don't fly him on Spirit Airlines.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 If you're getting ready, it's 15 minutes past the hour.

150
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Here's your morning roundup.

151
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Some of the stories you need to know to get your day going.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Investigators in Pennsylvania are trying to determine whether the suspect who allegedly set fire to Governor Josh Shapiro's residence

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 was motivated by anti-Semitism.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 The governor and his family were there at the time, asleep inside.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 We're looking at the possibility that it was geared towards the governor's, well, his religion and his views on Israel.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And according to court records, the suspect claimed that he would have attacked,

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 attacked the governor with a hammer if he had seen him.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Cody Balmer faces several charges, including attempted homicide, aggravated arson and terrorism.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And in Hungary, the parliament there passed an amendment that gives the government permission to ban public LGBTQ plus events

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 before the vote opposing politicians and protesters attempted to block the entrance to the parliament's garage.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Police removed them.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Critics say this is another step towards authoritarianism by the government there.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And there is a new study showing how using technology may be linked to a lower risk for dementia.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Researchers were looking at the theory that if we rely too much on technology, then it could hurt our cognitive abilities as we age.

165
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 But they claim based on their research of previous studies, that might not be true.

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And a five point two magnitude earthquake rattled Southern California to start the week.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 You can see the moment that it hit on this video when a mother quickly picks up her baby and runs out of the house.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 So some twenty five million people died.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And people felt the shaking from L.A. to San Diego.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Since I've been here since 2001, we've never I've never felt one like this because it was only three miles away.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And scientists are now on alert for the potential risk of act of aftershocks.

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And I want you to see this as the ground began to shake in San Diego.

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Elephants at the zoo there went into survival mode, springing into action to protect their young, just like that mom did.

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 The herd quickly scrambled to huddle up and shield the two.

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Seven year old younger elephants giving us a glimpse of how animals handle things in the wild.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Still coming up on CNN this morning, President Trump's tariffs are leaving many industries in limbo.

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 But at least one group is hopeful they'll get a reprieve.

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Plus, your taxes are due today and we're looking at the Trump administration's reported plans for the IRS.

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And I want to say good morning to St. Louis.

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 That's where we're monitoring a fire at a commercial building.

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 You can see some of the smoke and flames there actually just under the arch.

182
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 So the highest court in the land says the Trump administration needs to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego-Garcia.

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 According to Merriam-Webster's dictionary, the word facilitate means to make something easier.

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But making his return easier appears to conflict with the White House's plans.

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 How can I return him to the United States?

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 It's like I smuggle him into the United States.

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 I don't have the power to return him to the United States.

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him.

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 That's not up to us.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 If they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 So I want to bring in Republican election lawyer Ben Ginsburg because we've been talking the last couple days about this Maryland father who had been deported due to, quote unquote, an administrative error.

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Attorney Ginsburg, we have heard a lot about the reasons for why this happened.

193
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 We've also heard different reasons for why they can't bring him back.

194
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 First, can you just talk about the Trump administration's interpretation of what the Supreme Court said when it said facilitate this return?

195
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 The Trump administration's interpretation of this is, I think, certainly different from the way the trial judge in Maryland interpreted the word and probably the way the U.S. Supreme Court did as well.

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 In other words, this was.

197
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 An individual who did not have any due process rights, who was wrongly deported by the government's own admission.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And so to facilitate that return would imply in common usage that the person should be brought home.

199
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 So you've got a very different message yesterday in the in the Oval Office.

200
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Yeah, the reason why I've been asking is because, I mean, we heard even Stephen Colbert on late night saying what people hear is the common sense interpretation to bring him back.

201
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And you have two people, two.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 World leaders who have basically made themselves they're recognized for their attempts to have power.

203
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Right. And you have El Salvador's president calling himself the coolest dictator.

204
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 So what does it mean when they say, well, I can't do it and well, I can't do it.

205
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And then no one does it.

206
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Well, these are two very powerful people who you intuitively know could make it happen if they wanted to.

207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 So the answer is they don't.

208
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And from the Trump administration perspective, this appears to be one of several instances where they are trying out the powers of the executive branch.

209
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 In other words, here you've got their theory of a very strong presidency, the unitary presidency executive, where they don't have to listen to any other branch of government.

210
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And their opponent in this case is not only the courts, but the due process rights.

211
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And so this is the case that is going to tee up very much just how much power the president, the executive branch really can exert in the face of pushback by a co-equal branch of government.

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 I want to underscore something you just said about due process there, because the Trump administration claims that Garcia is a terrorist.

213
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 It's probably in part because the gang they claim he's a part of, they've also described as a terrorist organization.

214
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Here's what Homeland Security.

215
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Official said yesterday.

216
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 The media would love for you to believe that this is a media darling, that he's just some Maryland father.

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Well, Osama bin Laden was also a father, and yet he wasn't a good guy.

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And they actually are both terrorists.

219
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Help me understand this analogy.

220
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I mean, I mean, yeah, I just need help.

221
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Well, this was someone who was in the United States married to a U.S. citizen, which generally confers citizenship rights.

222
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And the larger point is that he was in the U.S.

223
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 There was an order in 2019 from a court saying he shouldn't be deported.

224
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Now he was deported.

225
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Normally, under our system of government, under the rule of law, that means there has to be due process.

226
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 In other words, a trial here in 2025 before he can be taken away from the country and put in prison.

227
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 In this case, the administration.

228
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 The administration has acted as judge and jury on his status.

229
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And so in the normal course of things, there is an immigration judge who should hear and determine whether he is a member of the gang and whether he does deserve to stay in the country or not.

230
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Ben Ginsberg, I've talked to you in the past because as a Republican, you have in the past represented administrations and Republicans in campaign issues, right, in an election law.

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 When you see something like this, as you said, the administration acting as judge and jury in one context, immigration, which I think is in some ways understandable legally, what implication does it have for other areas of the law?

232
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 What are you looking for in the coming days and weeks?

233
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Well, as I said, this is really setting up how much power the administration and the president can exert without involving the two other branches of government.

234
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Right. So there are other examples of this.

235
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 The whole tariff policy is part of it.

236
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Not spending money that Congress has appropriated, going after universities, going after the news media.

237
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 It is really are there checks and balances on the executive branch today?

238
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And so that's that's really a matter of the rule of law and the fundamentals of the Constitution that you have to learn.

239
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Look at to see. Can the administration basically ignore orders from courts is, I think, where this issue will be focused the most.

240
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Although certainly the role of Congress in appropriating money and setting up programs and whether the administration can just unilaterally end them or not will be other flashpoints.

241
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 OK, Ben Ginsberg, thank you for your insights. Appreciate you for being here on CNN this morning.

242
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Thank you.

243
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Thank you.

244
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Still to come, the case that helped set off the MeToo movement is back in court.

245
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Harvey Weinstein on trial again.

246
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Plus, what President Trump said about so-called homegrown criminals and where he's willing to send them.

247
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 On Love It or List It, the homeowner is always right.

248
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Whether I find them a brand new home.

249
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I mean, look at this incredible space.

250
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Or I use my design background to help them redo their home.

251
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Or I use my design background to help them redo their home.

252
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Or I use my design background to help them redo their existing house.

253
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Welcome home.

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Oh, my God.

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 It's the same space, but it feels so much bigger.

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Paige, can I give you an extra garage?

257
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 No. David will.

258
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Now the competition has begun.

259
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Paige Turner joins Love It or List It.

260
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Season premiere Monday, April 21st at 10.

261
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 See it first on HGTV and stream next day on Max.

262
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Just give up your day job.

263
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 No.

264
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 There are things that matter more than simply the size of one's endowment.

265
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Harvard is refusing to bend to the government's demands, rejecting its request for policy

266
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 changes on campus.

267
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Good morning, everybody.

268
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I'm Audie Cornish.

269
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 I want to thank you for joining me on CNN this morning.

270
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 It's half past the hour here on the East Coast, and here's what's happening right now.

271
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 No surrender.

272
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Harvard University's president says the school won't comply with Trump administration demands

273
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 to change school policies.

274
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 The president wants to cut Harvard off from more than $2 billion in federal grants and

275
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 $60 million in contracts over student activism and DEI policies.

276
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Harvard's president says it won't, quote, surrender its independence or its constitutional

277
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 rights.

278
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And Harvey Weinstein's retrial begins today with jury selection in New York.

279
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 An appeals court threw out his previous conviction.

280
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And a 23-year prison sentence.

281
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 The case today includes an allegation from an accuser who wasn't part of his first trial.

282
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And a hearing this afternoon could help determine the next steps in the case of Kilmar Abrego

283
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Garcia.

284
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 He's the man the Trump administration admits they mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

285
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 The Supreme Court ordered them to facilitate his return.

286
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 But both the U.S. Attorney General and the president of El Salvador say he's not going

287
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 anywhere.

288
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And so for now, he remains in El Salvador's notorious megalomaniac.

289
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 He's not going to take a prison.

290
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So who could be next on the deportation list?

291
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Maybe U.S. citizens.

292
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 We always have to obey the laws, but we also have homegrown criminals that push people

293
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when

294
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 they're not looking, that are absolute monsters.

295
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I'd like to include them in the group of people to get them out of the country.

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Group chat is back.

297
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 We'll start with you, Phil, because I know you've done some investigating into this

298
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 kind of policy.

299
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 What's the thinking here?

300
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Yeah.

301
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 About a month ago, myself, my colleague Priscilla Alvarez, did a deep dive story into how President

302
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Bukele first brought this idea to Marco Rubio.

303
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 So he brought it to the Secretary of State?

304
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Yes.

305
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 When Rubio visited El Salvador on his first foreign trip swing through Central America.

306
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And who brought it to Nayib Bukele but Eric Prince, the former head of Blackwater, who

307
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 is in contact with him and has a good relationship with him.

308
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And that matters a lot here.

309
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Because that was the genesis of the U.S. sending undocumented immigrants down to El Salvador,

310
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 as we've seen, and as obviously there's a current major political issue that the administration

311
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 is dealing with here.

312
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 But it's also the genesis of the idea of sending American criminals down to El Salvador, which

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 when it was offered to Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, State Department didn't really say

314
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 a whole lot.

315
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 I think they understood the legal, it was rather tenuous.

316
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Like a new Guantanamo situation?

317
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Or like, what's the offer here?

318
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 This is why you should pay attention to what's being said right now.

319
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And actually there were a couple of comments that Trump made related to this yesterday

320
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 that hinted at some things that are going on behind the scenes.

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And what they are trying to figure out right now with private contractors, and Eric Prince

322
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 and his operation have a proposal that's in play as well, is basically giving the U.S.

323
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 some type of military base slash diplomatic operation that would be U.S. territory within

324
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 El Salvador.

325
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 In exchange, the U.S. would help finance multiple prisons, like the Succo prison that is where

326
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 kind of the infamous one that everybody talks about.

327
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And that would be a plausible way to make this happen.

328
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Why?

329
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I don't have a great answer for you on that.

330
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 But to your point, this hot mic moment between the President, President Trump and the President

331
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 of El Salvador gives us a sense of just how into it this idea he is.

332
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Homegrown criminals are next.

333
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I said homegrowns are next.

334
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 The homegrowns, you've got to build about five more places.

335
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Okay.

336
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 We've got to process what we're hearing here because Phil has given us a lot of information.

337
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 You've got to build about five more places.

338
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 We're gearing up for something, right?

339
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 This is not just a winding down of a smaller story about one deportee.

340
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 What are you guys hearing in your reporting or where you're from?

341
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 I think this is why, you know, if you're a U.S. citizen, it's so important to pay attention

342
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 to what's happening to visa holders, to TPS recipients, you know, people who don't, permanent

343
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 residents, whatever, if they can, you know, sort of disappear, someone under that legal

344
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 framework.

345
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And we're seeing right now with the Supreme Court, as we talked about, whether that can

346
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 occur.

347
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 You know, obviously the idea that he could deport U.S. citizens is pretty legally implausible,

348
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 like Phil said, but it's all about sort of making strides here, right?

349
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 If they can do it to one population, they can sort of escalate that and escalate that.

350
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And so I think, can he do it, right, was sort of the thesis of Trump 1.0.

351
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I think Trump 2.0 is less, can he do it?

352
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 He's going to try to do things.

353
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Is, you know, are the courts and are these co-equal branches of government powerful enough

354
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 to stand in his way?

355
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 You know, and it's not clear exactly.

356
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 I mean, we're reaching.

357
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 One of those moments right now is kind of we're butting right up against the courts

358
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 to see exactly what they will do.

359
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 You have Democrats basically saying the courts need to hold the line, potentially hold the

360
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Trump administration in contempt.

361
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And we'll see exactly where that lands.

362
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 The other thing I find kind of interesting about all of this is we've now seen the precedent

363
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 from the Oval Office meeting just yesterday that we're kind of setting up the space where

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 if they go through with this sort of plan, you can have, well, it's not my jurisdiction.

365
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Well, it's not my jurisdiction.

366
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And then you're left in this black site space, essentially.

367
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Yeah.

368
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 It's the definition of facilitate.

369
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I definitely want to know the definition of homegrown.

370
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Like I don't want that to be a broad definition.

371
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Correct.

372
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And so when you have this kind of you're setting up the scenario where maybe to run the hypothetical

373
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 a little too far, but you kind of have to where you have a U.S. citizen sent to some

374
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 foreign prison and there's no real ramifications or how to get them back should the legal process

375
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 play out or what the legal process even looks like.

376
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 So I want to come to you before we move on.

377
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Because I feel like this is one of those moments where in the media we'll be accused

378
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 of like spinning this up or overhyping or raising alarms.

379
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 But I mean, what you're telling me out of your reporting is that we're on a path to

380
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 someplace and we're not there yet.

381
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Yeah.

382
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So figuring out one, the build process, the actual getting U.S. territory and what it

383
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 would actually look like process.

384
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 But you've laid out some of it, military contractors, a foreign country that's willing.

385
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 There's a draft proposal that the administration has their hands on.

386
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 There are other contractors that are also.

387
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Also trying to get into the space.

388
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 They believe that this is a viable option right now.

389
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 They believe this is something clearly El Salvador's president put it on the table initially

390
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and clearly the Trump administration, despite some initial reticence, is now look, this

391
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 is one of the situations where if people accuse you of getting spun up or making too big of

392
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 a deal about something, you point them back to what the president was saying.

393
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 The president was talking about this explicitly in the Oval Office with President Bukele.

394
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 This was not something that they were hiding the ball on.

395
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 It is very clear that this is something that they're talking about, how they do it, the

396
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 timeline for.

397
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 What that would be and also the process that they would actually pursue.

398
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Nobody really knows right now, but the only thing that I think everybody needs to keep

399
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 in mind, and we've talked about this before, failure of imagination is not something that

400
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 people I think should be able to claim at this point in time.

401
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And it is clear when you watch in the Oval Office that this is something that kind of

402
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 animates them and that they think is a plausible idea.

403
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 And based on everything we've seen over the last three months.

404
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Why wouldn't they?

405
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Yeah.

406
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 All right.

407
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Stay with us.

408
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 We've got a lot more to discuss here.

409
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Uh, because as we close out tax season tips.

410
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Today, I want to talk about the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency or Doge

411
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 and its reported plans for the IRS joining me now to discuss her latest reporting on

412
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 this.

413
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Senior politics reporter at Wired, McKenna Kelly.

414
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Good morning, McKenna.

415
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Welcome to the show.

416
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Right now, the IRS runs dozens of different systems housed and onsite data centers in

417
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 the cloud.

418
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 You got to have special permissions.

419
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Workers have like need to know access.

420
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 So what's this hackathon trying to do?

421
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 How is it trying to change things?

422
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Yeah.

423
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Sure.

424
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 So last week, what happened is that the IRS brought in a group of dozens of career IRS

425
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 engineers, along with two Doge representatives, Sam Korkos and Gavin Klieger, and a handful

426
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 of Palantir engineers for a three-day summit hackathon at the IRS building in D.C. where

427
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 they all sat together and planned out this giant project to connect all systems and all

428
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 data within the IRS into one centralized area.

429
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Where someone or a company or a company or a company or a company or a company or a company

430
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 or a company or a company or a company or a company or a company or a company or a company

431
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 or a company or a company or a company or a company or a company or a company or a company

432
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 or a company or a company or company people with special permissions would be able to

433
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 basically get access to whatever IRS data they sought with this new system.

434
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 And these discussions are still ongoing this week as well.

435
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 You mentioned Palantir.

436
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 I think I just heard that NATO is finalizing a deal with them for AI-fueled information

437
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 sharing between nations.

438
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 So that's the use in a military context.

439
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Can you talk about what it means?

440
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 for these outside engineers to be able to create the systems that talk to each other

441
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 that house our data in the IRS?

442
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Sure. I mean, this is something that folks in the government have been wanting to do

443
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 for a very long time.

444
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Earlier last month, I reported that Doge is talking about something similar

445
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 at the Social Security Administration and wanting to rewrite

446
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 the Social Security Administration's code base.

447
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And these projects, you know, these are commonly called modernization projects.

448
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And typically they take anywhere from like five to ten years to accomplish.

449
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And so even if you come at this IRS project with the perspective that it is something good,

450
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 wanting to get it done in the 30-day time frame that Doge is wanting to finish it in,

451
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 a lot of people sent a lot of red flags.

452
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Talk about those red flags.

453
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 As you mentioned, I think in the Wired reporting, the Trump administration actually canceled

454
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 a lot of those modernization projects that were actually in place

455
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 to do all this.

456
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 In order to do it this 30-day way.

457
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 So what are the red flags in this 30 days?

458
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Sure. For 30 days, I mean, there's a lot of things that can go wrong.

459
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Maybe you forget some kind of system to hook up or even you don't have enough time

460
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 to test all possible edge cases to show, you know, to prove that your system is set up properly

461
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 and that it's not going to miss anyone, that it's not going to miss, you know,

462
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 anybody's specific tax return or miss anybody's, you know,

463
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 data and get it wrong, mismatch Social Security numbers, mismatch names or addresses and things like that.

464
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Right. So we excuse me.

465
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 So we know that essentially the IRS has our work histories, right?

466
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 It has our Social Security number.

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 It has all of this information.

468
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Is there a threat of someone creating a backdoor?

469
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Is there a threat of someone having access to this information that could use it in a private industry context without us?

470
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 No.

471
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 No.

472
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 No.

473
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 No.

474
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 I don't know.

475
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 How many times have I gone and said, well, we want you to give us access to this stuff without our permission.

476
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Are those concerns overblown from civil liberties' folks?

477
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Yeah, so I mean, what happens here is when you have it easy to glean that place,

478
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 it becomes a lot easier to see everything at once.

479
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Right now, the IRS and the SSA and other agencies,

480
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 a lot of this data is inherently siloed.

481
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 So it's more difficult for people to

482
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 certain types of data. All the conversations that I've had with IRS workers over the last week have

483
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 basically said, when you leave your, you know, your day long training of your first day at the

484
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 IRS, the first thing, if you did not learn anything, what I'm told, you're told, you learn

485
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 that you're not supposed to access people's taxpayer information. If you just like decided

486
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 to look up someone who maybe, you know, is a somebody who you might be dating or something

487
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 like that, that is like an immediate, you're no longer working in government ever again type

488
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 thing. And so this, this kind of system that is being made would possibly make those kinds of

489
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 searches easier. McKenna Kelly, thank you so much. Still head on CNN this morning, the Trump

490
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 administration now thinking about another carve out on tariffs. It's time for cars. We'll talk

491
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 about that and more with Democratic Congressman Don Beyer, who will join us live. Plus, fumble

492
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 how the White House is going to do it.

493
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 The White House visit for college football's national champs didn't go exactly as planned. We're

494
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 from the group chat after this. That $86,000 car becomes $103,000 car overnight. But I'm telling

495
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 you right now, the impacts of these tariffs are going to make Americans lose jobs. Okay,

496
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 so that's one car dealership owner describing how those new 25% tariffs on all car imports

497
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 are affecting the United States.

498
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 That's a good question.

499
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 We're in the middle of a bubble, and there are so many New Yorkers who have been

500
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 expecting prices for his vehicles, but now in the middle of all these tariff changes and chaos,

501
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 President Trump is considering yet another exemption, this time for car companies.

502
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 I'm looking at something to help some of the car companies with their switching to parts that were

503
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 made in Canada, Mexico, and other places, and they need a little bit of time because they can make

504
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 them here, but they need a little bit of time, so I'm talking about things like that.

505
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Stock prices for carmakers like Audi and the Ford F-250, that's a good question.

506
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I'm certainly looking at it this year, but I'm looking at the future of car prices, I'm looking at

507
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 some things, I like to see the future of cars to come back here, I think, well, there's still that

508
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Stock prices for carmakers like Ford, General Motors,

509
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Talantis all went up 3% to 4% after those comments.

510
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 So joining me now to talk about this is Democratic Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia.

511
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Congressman, thanks for being here.

512
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Thank you, Ani. Thanks for the invitation.

513
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 So you're not just any congressman in this conversation.

514
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 We're talking to you because you at one point sold cars,

515
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 and then you actually have gone back to school to do machine learning and AI.

516
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 So you are uniquely positioned to talk about two things here.

517
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 One, the effect that these tariffs are having now on this industry,

518
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 and two, the hopes for the future, right,

519
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 in some scenario where manufacturing is brought back to the U.S.

520
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 So first, just reacting to the now.

521
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 What does it mean when the president can just say, oh, there's an exemption?

522
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Does that kind of undercut the argument for the tariffs?

523
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Does that help the industries that start complaining?

524
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Not in the middle run or the long run.

525
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 It may help today.

526
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 I've talked to a number of carmakers.

527
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 I've talked to car dealer friends.

528
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 You know, I sold out five years ago, so I have no interest in it now.

529
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 But still a great emotional interest in it.

530
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 And what everyone's telling me is that they have no idea what's coming next.

531
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 There's an enormous amount of uncertainty.

532
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 I asked a dear friend yesterday who has lots of dealerships,

533
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 can I count on him to hire some of our unemployed federal workers?

534
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 He said no, because he doesn't know what's coming.

535
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 In the short run, the fear of tariffs is making the dealerships very busy places.

536
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 But they're selling out of everything that's hot.

537
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 And they're very concerned that the next round is going to be $10,000, $15,000, $25,000 more expensive.

538
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 I love that you were talking about displaced workers,

539
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 because we were hearing from the head of the United Auto Workers Union in recent days.

540
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Here's what he had to say.

541
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 The Trump administration is the first administration in my lifetime that's been willing to do something about this broken free trade system.

542
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Tariffs are the first thing that's going to happen.

543
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 They're the first step.

544
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 But we need to put out our vision for an auto industry that doesn't leave behind working class people.

545
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Trade policy has been a fault line running through the Democratic Party, and it breaks apart in these moments.

546
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 So what do you say to those voters who agree with Sean Fain?

547
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 That tariffs have never been good for our country.

548
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 The last time we had tariffs like this was Smoot-Hawley in early 1930s, June 1930.

549
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And that gave us the great.

550
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Depression.

551
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Tariffs make us poorer.

552
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 They are a tax on the American consumer.

553
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 They lead to retaliation.

554
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 We've seen the retaliation the EU is willing to do last week.

555
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 China's hitting us with 124 percent tariffs.

556
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Our expenses are all going to go up, and it's not going to bring back those kinds of jobs that went overseas for comparative advantage.

557
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 American workers don't want to be, as a Latinx said, screwing tiny little screws in the tiny little iPhones.

558
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 We want the.

559
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Service jobs and the the much more technical manufacturing jobs that exist right now.

560
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 And that's why I'm coming back.

561
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 And we don't really want them back.

562
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 We want to employ American workers with the skills and the education that we have.

563
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 The backdrop to all of this are these rapid advances in artificial intelligence because they have a direct implication to what we mean when we talk about the future of manufacturing on my podcast.

564
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I was talking to Microsoft's CEO of.

565
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 AI.

566
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Mustafa Suleiman, and he actually says that we're talking about regulation, and I was asking him sort of what more could be done.

567
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Does there need to be more regulation?

568
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 And so I think that in most of these situations we have to wait, you know, and see, monitor closely, be prepared to react really fast, be proactive and transparent, hold ourselves accountable in the best possible way.

569
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Invite, you know, invite everybody in to kind of debate and discuss what.

570
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 They're seeing and just keep a very open mind.

571
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 But so far, I don't see any evidence that it's time for some unprecedented regulatory action.

572
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Congressman, you're on the Congressional AI Task Force.

573
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 The president has rolled back many of the AI protections that the Biden administration had put in place via executive order.

574
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 But I know you're studying these things.

575
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 So what is your response to what you just heard?

576
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 It reminds me of St.

577
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Augustine, who said, Dear Lord, make me a better person.

578
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 But not yet.

579
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 And that's what I'm hearing from the Eric Schmitz and the Sam Waltman's and Mustafa's is that, yes, there's room for regulation, but not yet.

580
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And I think that that's we want a light touch on regulation.

581
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Certainly we want to keep the world open for innovation, but it's time to look at things like transparency and safety.

582
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 One of the things that Trump's AI executive order did was it undid the safety institute at the National Institute for Standards and Technology that Biden had created.

583
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 And I think that's a mistake.

584
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 We need to be leaning on it, not suppressing innovation, but making sure that our models are tested, that they're safe and that they're transparent.

585
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Congressman Beyer, I have one more question, which is that essentially you have a lot of Democrats praising Harvard for how it's sort of standing up to the Trump administration.

586
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 You, among others, have been critical of the Democrats not having a unified voice, a unified message when it comes to standing up to the Trump administration.

587
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 What would you like to see?

588
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Does this feel like a turning point?

589
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Yeah, I was very encouraged by it, very discouraged by the Paul Lysas and the Skadden Arps that caved.

590
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 I think we've learned going back to the Old Testament times that when confronted with a bully, the best thing to do is to stand up to that bully rather than just surrender.

591
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 And those folks who surrender so far, history is not going to treat them well.

592
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Harvard is strong enough to last one Donald Trump.

593
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Congressman Don Beyer, thank you for your time.

594
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Thank you for being here on CNN this morning.

595
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 It's now 56 minutes past the hour.

596
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 I want to give the rest of you the roundup, some of the stories you need to know to get your day going.

597
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 At this moment, fire crews are battling a large fire burning at a pallet company in East St. Louis.

598
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 These are live images of those flames.

599
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 CNN affiliate KMOV reports an explosion from a truck near the building actually started this fire, and it's being fueled by the wood that's used to make those pallets.

600
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Also, former President Joe Biden set to give his first public speech since he left office.

601
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 This evening, he's giving a keynote address at a conference in Chicago.

602
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Plus, Vice President J.D. Vance had a bit of a fumble with the Ohio State University football team.

603
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 The national champs brought their trophy to the White House, but as he picked it up, it broke into two pieces.

604
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 The former Ohio senator joked that he did it on purpose to prevent anyone else from winning it.

605
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Phil, you're the only person I want to hear from on this.

606
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 Yeah, shout out trivia.

607
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Anderson, for having his back right there, no fumbles in his career.

608
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Look, he's a Buckeye alum, J.D. Vance, but he also went to Yale.

609
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 We don't expect the Ivy League kids, really, to perform.

610
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 That's why, you know, those of us not Ivies, stop sending me the clip.

611
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Everyone in America has sent me the clip.

612
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 I've seen it. I get it.

613
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 You were like, I go to Ohio, I care about football, and so now you get the clip.

614
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Yeah, it was awesome.

615
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 No, the event.

616
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 Oh, the event.

617
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 But, like, you should know the gold part detaches.

618
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Like, everybody who watches football knows that.

619
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 So I'm a little skeptical of...

620
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Wait, for real?

621
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Yeah, it's not supposed to...

622
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 You pick up the gold part, not the base.

623
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 You're not starting a conspiracy theory, are you?

624
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 No, I just watched football.

625
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Okay.

626
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Like, that's how I...

627
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Okay.

628
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 My team won.

629
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 I watched them pick it up repeatedly.

630
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Let me just get back to the news, okay, in this side of the group chat.

631
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 There's always one part of the group chat that you have to be like, mute.

632
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Anyway, we're going to talk about what we're keeping an eye on today.

633
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 We're going to start with Kevin.

634
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Thank you.

635
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 So, AOC in Brazil.

636
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Bernie have been hitting the trail out west.

637
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 They did this last month.

638
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 They're doing it again now.

639
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 We're talking massive rallies.

640
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 You're, like, hitting the trail.

641
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 This is thousands of people.

642
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 Tens of thousands of people at these various events.

643
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Not all of them in very blue areas.

644
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 And so they've wrapped up Idaho and Salt Lake City over the last two days.

645
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 They're supposed to go to Montana tomorrow.

646
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 They're wrapping up some California ones today.

647
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 So just keeping an eye on that and what it says about the Democratic angst and desire for some sort of message in this moment.

648
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 Okay, Gabby Bierenbaum.

649
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 Oh, I mean...

650
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 You know Nevada, but what's your look ahead?

651
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 So I'm looking at, I think, Kevin, you are too.

652
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 In Nevada, New York, and some other states, there are these Republicans whose districts have reaped massive benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act, the climate law that Democrats passed in 2022.

653
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 This is a key area that Republicans are looking to cut spending.

654
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 They're looking to revoke some of these tax credits towards companies in the renewable energy space.

655
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 And it puts a lot of Republicans in an awkward position.

656
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Right, because there were Republicans who really moved forward in the renewable energy space.

657
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Yeah, and you don't have to be, you know, super into climate change to feel that there's a business.

658
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 There's a business case to be made that this is jobs, this is energy savings, what have you.

659
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 And so they're sort of working behind the scenes, and we're going to see if they're able to influence the bill.

660
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Last seconds to Phil.

661
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 Trump administration officials have been very dismissive about China's ability to fight a trade war publicly.

662
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Something changed yesterday.

663
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director, said the rare earth export controls were very concerning that had been put on.

664
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 China basically controls the entire market, absolutely integral.

665
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 They're concerned.

666
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 And that's interesting to me.

667
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 All right, thanks to our group.

668
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Chad, thank you for waking up with us.

669
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 I'm Hadi Cornish, CNN News, the real news.

670
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 CNN News Central starts right now.

671
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 This is why you can't be on.

672
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 This week on The Assignment with me, Hadi Cornish.

673
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 People often say these models suffer hallucinations.

674
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 They make stuff up.

675
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Well, actually, they're designed to make things up, right?

676
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 We want them to tell us something that we don't know.

677
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 The CEO of Microsoft AI.

678
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Microsoft AI, Mustafa Suleiman, on the next era of the tech industry and about what it means to hold on to your values when the industry is moving faster than the rules meant to govern it.
